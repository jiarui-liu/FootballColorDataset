This is especially true in today's society, where material possessions and status symbols are highly valued. People have a tendency to constantly strive for more, whether it be more money, more possessions, or more recognition. This is especially true of younger generations, who are often more focused on \"keeping up with the Joneses\" than on being content with what they have. \n\nFor example, take a look at the rise of social media. People are constantly posting pictures and updates about their lives, often to show off their possessions and achievements in an effort to make it seem as though their life is perfect. This creates an unrealistic expectation that everyone else should strive for, leading to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction when they don't have the same things. \n\nFurthermore, this mentality has caused people to become more and more disconnected from the world around them. People are so focused on their own wants and needs that they don't take the time to appreciate what they already have or to help those who are less fortunate. This is a problem because it leads to a lack of empathy and understanding, and it prevents us from making the world a better place. \n\nIn conclusion, people are never satisfied with what they have, and this is a problem because it leads to a lack of contentment, disconnection from the world, and an inability to make the world a better place.", "aae_essay": "People have an insatiable desire to always want more, to the point where they are never satisfied with what they already have. This is especially true in today's society, where material possessions and social media have created an unrealistic standard of living that many strive to achieve. People are constantly comparing their lives to others and feeling like they are not enough, or that they need to have the latest and greatest things in order to be happy. This mentality has caused people to become discontent with their lives and always seek for more. \n\nOne of the main reasons why people are never satisfied with what they have is because of the constant pressure to have the latest and greatest material possessions. Social media has created an unrealistic standard of living that many strive to achieve, making people feel like they are not enough if they don't have the latest phone, car, or clothes. This leads to people feeling like they need to keep up with the Joneses and constantly upgrade their possessions in order to be happy. \n\nAnother reason why people are never satisfied is because they are always looking for the next best thing. People are constantly searching for the newest trends and fads, and when something new comes out they feel like they need to switch it up and try something different. This leads to people being bored easily and never being content with what they have. \n\nFinally, people are never satisfied with what they have because they are always looking for the quick fix. People are constantly searching for the easy way out, and think that if they just had more money, better looks, or more knowledge then they would be happy.

People have an innate desire to strive for more, to improve upon what they already have, or to find something new and exciting. This is especially true in today's society, where material possessions and instant gratification are often prioritized over long-term satisfaction. \n\nTake, for example, the current trend of consumerism. People are constantly buying and upgrading their possessions, from smartphones to cars to homes, in an effort to stay ahead of the curve and to have the latest and greatest items. This is often done at the expense of saving for the future or investing in long-term goals. People are also constantly seeking out new experiences, from traveling to trying new hobbies, in an effort to find something that will bring them a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment. \n\nThis desire for more and different is also evident in relationships. People are constantly looking for new partners or trying to improve their existing relationships. This can be seen in the dating world, where people are constantly swiping right and looking for the perfect match, or in relationships, where people are constantly trying to find ways to spice things up and make them feel new and exciting. \n\nIn conclusion, people are never satisfied with what they have and are always looking for something more or different.

They also have a better understanding of technology and can often provide valuable insight into how to use it to our advantage. \n\nFor example, when I was in high school, I was part of a student-led project to create a website for our school.

I was able to experience the highs and lows of the story and become invested in the characters' fates.

However, in adulthood, a person is more independent and has the opportunity to make their own decisions and shape their own destiny.

This is because during this period, a person's character, values, and beliefs are formed, as well as their sense of self-worth and identity. During this time, a child is also shaped by their environment and the people around them, and these influences can have a lasting impact on their future. \n\nFor example, when a child is exposed to positive reinforcement and support, they are more likely to develop a positive self-image and have higher self-esteem. This can lead to better academic performance and a greater sense of accomplishment. On the other hand, if a child is exposed to negative reinforcement, they may develop a negative self-image and low self-esteem, which can lead to poor academic performance and other issues. \n\nFurthermore, a child's formative years are the perfect time to instill values and beliefs. This is because a child is more likely to accept and internalize these values without question, as they are still forming their own beliefs and opinions. This can lead to a person who is more likely to make better decisions in the future, as they have a foundation of values to draw from. \n\nIn conclusion, a person's childhood years are the most important years of their life, as this is when a person's character, values, and beliefs are formed, as well as their sense of self-worth and identity.

This is because during this period, a person's brain is still developing and is highly malleable, making it the ideal time to lay the foundation for the rest of a person's life. For example, research has shown that children who are exposed to positive experiences, such as having loving and supportive parents, can develop resilience and a strong sense of self-esteem that can help them succeed in life. On the other hand, children who are exposed to negative experiences, such as abuse or neglect, can have lasting psychological and emotional scars that can impede their future success. \n\nFurthermore, a person's childhood years are also the time when they are most open to learning and absorbing information. During this period, a child is like a sponge, soaking up all the experiences and knowledge around them. This makes it the ideal time to instill values, habits, and skills that can be beneficial for the rest of a person's life. For example, a child who is taught the importance of helping others, or the value of hard work and determination, can carry these lessons with them for the rest of their life. \n\nIn conclusion, a person's childhood years are the most important years in their life, as this is when their brain is developing and they are most open to learning and absorbing information.

Investing in sports is just as important as investing in books, as it encourages physical activity, teamwork, and healthy competition. Furthermore, sports can be a great way for students to relax and have fun, as well as to develop leadership skills and a sense of community. For example, at my university, the athletic department provides a variety of services and resources to its student athletes, such as academic support, mental health services, and financial aid. Additionally, the university provides a variety of scholarships and grants to its athletes, which can be used towards tuition, books, and other expenses. All of these resources are essential for student athletes to succeed both on and off the field. \n\nFurthermore, investing in sports can also help universities attract more students and increase their reputation. For example, my university has a highly successful basketball team, which has helped to attract more students to the university and increase its reputation. Investing in sports can also help universities to build relationships with local businesses and corporations, which can lead to more funding and resources for the university. \n\nIn conclusion, universities should prioritize investing in their students\u2019 sports activities, as it encourages physical activity, teamwork, and healthy competition, while also providing essential resources and opportunities for student athletes. This investment can also help universities to attract more students, increase their reputation, and build relationships with local businesses and corporations.", "aae_essay": "Universities should prioritize investing in their libraries over their sports programs. The reason for this is that libraries provide a much greater benefit to the student body than sports do. Sports are a great way for students to stay active and have fun, but they do not provide the same educational benefits that a library does. Libraries provide a space for students to access a wealth of knowledge and resources that can help them in their studies. They also provide a space for students to work on group projects, study for exams, and get help from librarians with their research. In addition, libraries often host events such as lectures, workshops, and reading groups that can be beneficial to students. \n\nIn contrast, sports teams and activities often require a large financial investment from the university and often do not provide the same educational benefits. Sports teams may provide a sense of community and camaraderie, but these benefits can often be found in other activities such as clubs or student government. Furthermore, sports teams often require a large amount of resources from the university, such as equipment and coaches, which could be better used to fund the library. \n\nOverall, universities should prioritize investing in their libraries over their sports programs. Libraries provide a much greater educational benefit to the student body and can be used to foster a sense of community and learning without requiring the same financial investment that sports do.", "esl_essay": "I strongly agree that universities should provide the same amount of money for their students' sport activities as they do for their library. Investing in a strong and vibrant sports program is essential for the overall wellbeing of a university student body. Sports provide students with an outlet to stay active, make friends, and learn important life lessons such as teamwork and discipline. Furthermore, research has shown that students who participate in sports are more likely to have higher GPAs and graduate at higher rates than those who don't. \n\nFor example, at my university, the athletic department receives a large portion of the university's budget, while the library receives much less. This is a shame, because both are equally important for the student body. The library provides a space for students to study and do research, while the athletic department provides a space for students to stay active and learn important life lessons. \n\nIn conclusion, universities should provide equal funding for both their library and their athletic department, as both are essential for the overall wellbeing of their student body."}

On the positive side, I was able to appreciate the beauty of nature and the peace and quiet that comes with living in a rural area. I was also able to explore the outdoors and develop a deep appreciation for the environment. \n\nOn the other hand, there were some drawbacks to growing up in a rural area.

There are certain tasks and responsibilities that we must take on in life that we may not always find enjoyable, but they are necessary for our growth and development. For example, many people must work to earn a living, even if they do not enjoy their job. Doing so allows them to provide for themselves and their families, while also gaining skills and experience that can be used in other areas. Additionally, taking on unpleasant tasks can help us to develop our character and teach us valuable lessons that we can apply to other areas of our lives. For example, if we are forced to confront an unpleasant situation, we can learn to be more resilient and develop strategies to deal with difficult situations. \n\nFurthermore, there are certain activities that we must do for our own health and wellbeing. For example, exercising regularly is important for our physical and mental health, even if it is not something we enjoy. Eating healthy foods, getting enough sleep, and engaging in other healthy activities are also necessary for our wellbeing, even if they are not enjoyable. \n\nIn conclusion, while it is important to enjoy the activities we do, there are certain tasks and responsibilities that we must take on in life that we may not always find enjoyable. However, these activities are necessary for our growth and development, and can ultimately lead to a more fulfilling life.", "aae_essay": "I believe that people should do things that they don't necessarily enjoy sometimes, but it is important to have a good reason for doing so. For example, if someone doesn't like public speaking but they have to give a presentation at work, they should do it anyway because it is important for their career. Or if someone doesn't like exercising but knows that it is important for their health, they should force themselves to do it anyway. \n\nI have experienced this myself. I have had to do things that I didn't enjoy, but I knew that it was necessary for my own growth and development.

I didn't enjoy it at all, but I knew that it would help me become a better musician and learn more about music. So, I forced myself to practice and attend band practices even though it was difficult. In the end, it was worth it because I learned a lot and it helped me become a better musician. \n\nI think that it is important to do things that you don't enjoy sometimes because it can help you become a better version of yourself. It can also help you develop skills and grow as a person. It may not be easy, but it is necessary to push yourself out of your comfort zone and try new things.", "esl_essay": "I agree with the statement that people should sometimes do things they do not enjoy. There are many reasons why this is the case. Firstly, it is important to be able to develop our skills and abilities by challenging ourselves. Doing things we enjoy all the time can lead to a lack of growth and stagnation. Additionally, life is not always about pleasure and happiness, and sometimes we need to do things that are difficult or unpleasant in order to reach our goals. For example, if someone wants to become a doctor, they will have to put in a lot of hard work and dedication, which may not always be enjoyable. \n\nFurthermore, it is important to be able to help others in need. We can only do this if we are willing to step out of our comfort zones and do things that are difficult or unpleasant. For example, volunteering at a soup kitchen or helping a friend move house even though it is not something we enjoy. Doing things we do not enjoy can also help us to develop empathy and understanding for those who are in difficult situations. \n\nIn conclusion, while it is important to enjoy life and take pleasure in the things we do, sometimes we need to do things that are difficult or unpleasant in order to reach our goals, help others, and develop ourselves."}

Working in a particular field can give someone the chance to learn more about the industry and gain insight into what it takes to be successful in that field. Additionally, a job can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment that money alone cannot provide. \n\nFurthermore, a job can be a way to contribute to society.

We should take the time to get to know them and understand their background, culture, and beliefs. We should look for the beauty in each person and appreciate the unique qualities that make them who they are. \n\nFurthermore, judging a person by their external appearances can be dangerous and can lead to prejudiced and discriminatory actions.

Similarly, a person who is disheveled and unkempt may be signaling that they lack self-respect and care for their appearance. \n\nFurthermore, external appearances can be a window into a person's culture, background, and beliefs.

However, as I have gotten older, I have been able to look back and recognize that those struggles I had with math were actually valuable lessons that have helped me to develop my problem-solving and logical thinking skills. \n\nIn addition, I have also had experiences that were difficult at the time but that I have since been able to look back on and realize were not as important or significant as I had thought. For example, when I was younger, I was very competitive and would get frustrated if I didn't win at sports or other activities. I would think that the world was ending if I didn't come in first place, but now I realize that these experiences were just growing pains and that I have since been able to use those same competitive instincts to push myself to achieve greater successes. \n\nOverall, I believe that most experiences in our lives that seem difficult at the time eventually become valuable lessons for the future. We just need to be able to look back and recognize the value of the struggles we face."}

The social environment of the classroom can have a significant impact on a student's motivation and engagement in the learning process. Classmates can provide support, encouragement, and feedback that can be invaluable to a student. They can also provide a sense of belonging and camaraderie that can be essential for a student's self-esteem and sense of well-being. In addition, classmates can provide a student with a different perspective on the material being studied, and can challenge the student to think in new ways. \n\nFor example, when I was in school, I had a classmate who was very knowledgeable in math and science and was always willing to help me with my homework. He encouraged me to think critically and ask questions when I didn't understand something, and his enthusiasm for learning was contagious. He was a great source of support and motivation for me, and I am sure that I would not have achieved the same level of success in my studies without his help. \n\nIn conclusion, classmates can be a major factor in a student's success in school, and should not be overlooked.

This is because classmates can provide a student with both positive and negative influences that can have a lasting impact on their academic performance. \n\nFirstly, classmates can provide a student with a sense of belonging and camaraderie. When a student is surrounded by peers who are supportive and encouraging, they are more likely to feel motivated to do their best work. This can lead to improved grades and a greater desire to learn. On the other hand, if a student is surrounded by peers who are not supportive or who are negative influences, they can be discouraged and distracted from their studies. \n\nSecondly, classmates can provide a student with a different perspective on the material being taught. When a student is exposed to different viewpoints and ideas, they can gain a better understanding of the material and be able to apply it in different ways. This can lead to more creative solutions and better problem-solving skills. \n\nFinally, classmates can provide a student with the opportunity to collaborate and practice communication skills. Working with others on projects and assignments can help a student learn how to compromise, negotiate, and collaborate. This can be invaluable when it comes to working in the real world. \n\nIn conclusion, classmates can have a significant influence on a student's academic performance. They can provide both positive and negative influences that can shape a student's attitude and approach to learning. It is important for parents and teachers to recognize this and provide guidance and support to help students make positive connections with their peers.", "esl_essay": "I strongly disagree with the statement that classmates are more important influences than parents on a child's success in school. While it is true that a child's peers can provide support, encouragement, and feedback that can be invaluable to a child's learning, parents remain the primary influence on a child's success in school. Parents provide the foundation for a child's learning, providing the resources, support, and guidance that allow a child to develop the skills and habits necessary for success in school. They are the primary source of emotional support, providing the stability and security that allows a child to focus on their studies. They are also the primary educators, providing the knowledge and guidance that allows a child to understand the material they are learning. \n\nParents also have the unique ability to provide a child with the values and life lessons that are essential for success in life. They can teach a child the importance of hard work, perseverance, and respect, as well as the importance of helping others and being a responsible member of a community. They can also provide the guidance and support necessary for a child to develop healthy habits, such as the importance of proper nutrition, exercise, and adequate sleep. \n\nIn conclusion, while a child's peers can provide invaluable support and feedback, parents remain the primary influence on a child's success in school. They provide the resources, support, guidance, and values necessary for a child to develop the skills and habits necessary for success."}

In my opinion, the best way to ensure that both boys and girls receive a quality education is to have them attend the same school, where they can learn from each other and benefit from the diversity of the student body. \n\nFirstly, boys and girls learn in different ways and have different interests. By attending separate schools, they will not have the opportunity to learn from each other and gain a more well-rounded education. For example, boys may learn more effectively from a more structured, hands-on approach to learning, while girls may benefit from more discussion-based classes. By attending separate schools, these different learning styles will not be able to be explored. \n\nSecondly, by attending separate schools, boys and girls will not have the opportunity to learn how to interact with the opposite gender in a professional and respectful manner. In mixed-gender schools, they will learn to interact with each other in a more mature and respectful way, which can be beneficial in the workplace. \n\nFinally, by attending separate schools, boys and girls will not have the opportunity to form meaningful relationships with each other. In mixed-gender schools, they will learn to appreciate each other\u2019s differences and learn to collaborate with each other.

This means that boys and girls will learn in different ways, and it is important to provide an environment that caters to both learning styles. \n\nIn addition, boys and girls have different interests and needs. Boys may be more interested in sports and physical activities, while girls may be more interested in the arts and socializing. Separate schools would allow these interests to be nurtured and encouraged in a more focused environment. \n\nFinally, boys and girls need to be taught in different ways. Boys may need more structure and discipline, while girls may need more guidance and support.

Advertising can also be used to shape people's perceptions of a country by emphasizing certain aspects of its identity while downplaying others. For example, a country may emphasize its technological advancements while downplaying its environmental issues. \n\nIn addition, advertising can be used to create a sense of national pride and identity.

This can lead to a loss of authenticity and a distortion of the country\u2019s true identity. For example, many tourist destinations are now overrun with tacky souvenir shops and overpriced restaurants, and the local culture can become lost in the process. \n\nSecondly, advertising can also lead to a false impression of a country. Countries often use advertising to show only their best side, often leaving out the negative aspects of their culture or society. This can lead to a distorted view of the country, and can be damaging if people base their opinions of a country on these ads alone. \n\nFinally, advertising can be costly and ineffective. Countries often spend a lot of money on advertising, yet the return on investment is often not as great as hoped. This money could be better spent on improving infrastructure, education, or healthcare within the country. \n\nIn conclusion, while advertising can be used to showcase a country\u2019s culture and attract tourists and investors, it can also lead to an over-commercialization of the country, a false impression of its culture, and be costly and ineffective.", "esl_essay": "I agree with the statement that advertisement can tell you much about a country.

In the past, face-to-face conversations and handwritten letters were the primary methods of communication, allowing people to convey their emotions and intentions more easily. However, with the advent of telephones and email, conversations have become more impersonal, as people are unable to read facial expressions and body language, and written communication can be easily misinterpreted. \n\nFor example, when people communicate via email, they often fail to use the same level of formality and politeness that they would use in a face-to-face conversation. People are also more likely to be less thoughtful in their writing, as they do not have to consider the feelings of the recipient. Additionally, emails can be easily misinterpreted, as the sender may not be aware of the context or emotions of the recipient. \n\nFurthermore, telephones have made it easier for people to communicate without being in the same physical space. This has led to a decrease in the quality of conversations, as people are not as engaged in the conversation as they would be if they were in person. People also tend to be less mindful of their words when speaking on the phone, as they do not have to worry about facial expressions or body language. \n\nIn conclusion, telephones and email have made communication between people less personal, as conversations are less engaging and can be easily misinterpreted.

In some ways, it has made communication more personal, as people can now communicate with friends and family from anywhere in the world with a few clicks of a button. However, I believe that it has also made communication less personal, as people are increasingly relying on technology to communicate instead of talking face-to-face or picking up the phone. \n\nOne of the biggest changes I have noticed is that people are now more likely to send a quick text or email instead of picking up the phone to have a conversation. This has caused conversations to become shorter and less meaningful, as people are not taking the time to have in-depth conversations with one another.

In the past, face-to-face conversations and written letters were the primary methods of communication, allowing people to convey their emotions and intentions through tone, facial expressions, and body language. However, with the advent of telephones and emails, conversations have become impersonal and often lack the subtle cues that can be seen in person or written communications. \n\nFor example, when speaking on the phone, it is difficult to detect the subtle inflections in a person's voice that can convey empathy or understanding. Additionally, emails lack the subtle cues of body language that can help convey enthusiasm or sincerity. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, as the sender of the message may not be able to convey their true intentions. \n\nFurthermore, emails and telephones can also be impersonal because they can be used to send mass messages to multiple people at once, rather than having a personal conversation with an individual. This can lead to a lack of connection and make it difficult to build meaningful relationships. \n\nIn conclusion, telephones and emails have made communications between people less personal.

Teachers are the primary source of knowledge and guidance for students, and their effectiveness should be measured by the amount of progress their students make while under their tutelage. Teachers should be rewarded for their efforts in helping students reach their potential, and this can be done by tying their salaries to the academic progress of their students. \n\nFor example, teachers in Finland have salaries that are based on the number of students who achieve certain levels of proficiency in reading and math. This system encourages teachers to focus on student outcomes and rewards them for helping their students succeed. Additionally, this system provides an incentive for teachers to develop innovative and engaging lessons that help students learn and grow. \n\nFurthermore, this system also encourages teachers to take on more challenging classes, as their salary is not based on the number of students they have, but rather on the amount of progress their students make. This ensures that teachers are not penalized for having more difficult classes, and it also encourages them to take on students who may need extra help. \n\nIn conclusion, tying teacher salaries to student learning outcomes is an effective way to reward teachers for their hard work and dedication, while also encouraging them to develop innovative and engaging lessons. This system also encourages teachers to take on more challenging classes, which is beneficial for both the students and the teachers.", "aae_essay": "I believe that teachers should be paid based on how much their students learn, not just on the number of hours they put in. This is because teaching is a profession that requires a great deal of skill and dedication, and the success of a teacher should be measured by the amount of knowledge and understanding their students gain from them. \n\nFor example, a teacher who is able to help their students understand a difficult concept or master a challenging subject should be rewarded for their efforts. This is especially true when the teacher is able to do so in a way that inspires and motivates their students to learn more. \n\nFurthermore, teachers should be rewarded for their efforts in helping students develop critical thinking skills, problem-solving skills, and communication skills. These skills are essential for success in life and are often developed through the guidance of a teacher. \n\nFinally, teachers should be rewarded for their dedication to their students and their commitment to helping them reach their full potential. This is especially true for teachers who work in underprivileged or disadvantaged communities, where the students may not have access to the same resources as their peers. \n\nIn conclusion, teachers should be rewarded for the invaluable contributions they make to the education and development of their students.

If a teacher is not able to help their students reach their potential, then they should not be paid the same as a teacher who is able to do so. This would create an incentive for teachers to ensure that their students are making progress and learning as much as possible. \n\nFurthermore, teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn because it would help to attract and retain quality teachers.

On the other hand, being a member of a group allows one to benefit from the collective knowledge and experience of the other members.

Working together, you can also develop trust and camaraderie that can help you overcome any obstacle. \n\nFor example, when I was a member of my high school's robotics team, I saw firsthand how powerful it could be to work together. We had a small team of just five people, but together we were able to design and build a robot that was able to compete with and often beat much larger teams. We were able to do this by relying on each other's strengths and working together to overcome our weaknesses. We also developed strong bonds of friendship and trust that allowed us to work together seamlessly and push each other to do our best. \n\nIn addition, when you are part of a team, you have access to resources and knowledge that you wouldn't have if you were running the show.

This can lead to more creative solutions and ideas than if one person was trying to come up with the ideas alone. \n\nAdditionally, being a member of a group allows for more collaboration and support. When working on a project, it is easier to get feedback from other members and bounce ideas off of each other. This can help to ensure that the project is completed to the best of everyone\u2019s abilities. \n\nOn the other hand, being the leader of a group can be overwhelming and limiting. As the leader, you are responsible for making all the decisions and coming up with all the ideas.

This is because school uniforms can be restrictive and impose a sense of uniformity that does not reflect the individuality of each student. On the other hand, allowing students to choose what to wear to school gives them the freedom to express themselves and their individual style. Furthermore, students are more likely to take pride in their school when they have the freedom to choose what to wear. \n\nFor example, when students are allowed to choose their own clothing, they are more likely to take pride in their school and be more engaged in their learning. This is because when students have a say in what they wear, they feel like they are part of the school community and are more likely to take pride in their school. Additionally, when students have the freedom to choose their own clothing, they are more likely to express their individual style and personality. This can lead to a more positive school environment, as students will feel like they are being respected for who they are. \n\nIn conclusion, allowing students to choose what to wear to school is better than requiring them to wear school uniforms, as it gives them the freedom to express themselves, take pride in their school, and be engaged in their learning.", "aae_essay": "High school is a time of self-discovery and personal growth, and one of the ways students express themselves is through their clothing choices. Unfortunately, many schools have a uniform policy that limits students\u2019 ability to express themselves through their wardrobe. On one hand, a uniform policy can create a sense of unity and equality among students, as well as reduce socio-economic disparities in terms of what students can afford to wear. On the other hand, a uniform policy can be restrictive and limit students\u2019 creativity and individuality. \n\nIn my opinion, the best approach is a middle ground between the two. Schools should have a uniform policy, but it should be flexible enough to allow students to express themselves through their clothing choices. For example, students could be allowed to wear one piece of clothing that is not part of the school\u2019s uniform, such as a hat, a jacket, or a pair of shoes. This would give students the opportunity to express themselves while still following the school\u2019s dress code. \n\nFurthermore, schools should also provide students with the resources to learn how to express themselves through fashion. This could include offering classes on fashion and style, or providing students with access to fashion magazines and websites. This would help students to develop their own sense of style and learn how to express themselves through clothing without going against the school\u2019s uniform policy. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe that a school\u2019s uniform policy should be flexible enough to allow students to express themselves, while also providing resources to help students learn how to do so in a way that follows the school\u2019s guidelines.", "esl_essay": "I believe that the policy of allowing students to decide what they wear to school is better than the policy of requiring all students to wear school uniforms. This is because allowing students to choose what they wear gives them a sense of individuality and allows them to express themselves. School uniforms, on the other hand, can make students feel like they are part of a collective, rather than individuals, and can limit their freedom of expression. \n\nFor example, at my old school, students were allowed to choose what they wore to school. This gave them the opportunity to express their personal style and to feel like they were unique. They could wear whatever they wanted as long as it followed certain guidelines, such as no hats or head coverings indoors. This policy allowed them to express themselves and to feel like individuals. \n\nIn contrast, when I visited a school that had a uniform policy, I noticed that the students all looked very similar. They all wore the same thing and it was difficult to tell them apart. This lack of individuality made the school feel like a collective, rather than a group of individuals. It also limited the students' freedom of expression, as they could not express themselves through their clothing choices. \n\nOverall, I believe that allowing students to choose what they wear to school is better than requiring them to wear a uniform. This gives them a sense of individuality and allows them to express themselves, while a uniform policy limits their freedom of expression and makes them feel like they are part of a collective."}

By investing in renewable energy sources, we can create jobs, reduce emissions, and create a healthier planet. Additionally, humans have found ways to use resources more efficiently, such as recycling and reusing materials, which helps preserve resources for future generations. \n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that human activity has had a negative impact on the Earth, it is also true that humans have found ways to make the Earth a better place to chill. Through the development of renewable energy sources, more efficient resource use, and the preservation of resources, humans have taken steps to reduce the damage they have caused and make the Earth a better place to live.", "esl_essay": "I believe that human activity can both harm and make the Earth a better place for living. On the one hand, human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and over-fishing are contributing to global warming and the depletion of natural resources. This is causing an imbalance in the environment and leading to a decline in biodiversity. On the other hand, human activity can also have a positive impact on the Earth. Through technological advances, we have been able to reduce air and water pollution, increase crop yields, and provide access to clean water and better healthcare. We can also promote sustainable development and protect natural habitats to ensure that future generations can enjoy the planet."}

Human needs should not be prioritized over the needs of endangered animals, as their survival is essential for the health of our planet. \n\nFirstly, endangered animals are integral to the balance of the ecosystems they inhabit, and their absence would cause a disruption to the natural order.

For example, some species of insects pollinate plants, which are essential for our food supply. Other species provide us with medicines and materials that are used to create everyday items. \n\nFinally, endangered animals are a part of our cultural heritage and should be preserved for future generations to appreciate and learn from.

Working for a small company comes with many advantages that a big company cannot offer. For one, small companies often have a more intimate and family-like atmosphere, where employees are given more responsibility and are able to take on more diverse roles. In a small company, employees often have more direct contact with the top management and are able to have a greater influence on the company's decisions. Additionally, small companies often offer more flexible working hours and a more relaxed atmosphere, which can be beneficial for those who have other commitments outside of work. \n\nIn contrast, big companies often have a more rigid structure and bureaucratic system, which can make it difficult for employees to have an impact on the company's decisions. Additionally, big companies often have a more rigid hierarchy, which can make it difficult to move up the ladder and gain more responsibility. Furthermore, big companies often have a more impersonal atmosphere, where employees can become lost in the crowd. \n\nOverall, I believe that the advantages of working for a small company outweigh those of a big one. I prefer the more intimate atmosphere, the more flexible working hours, and the greater opportunities for advancement that a small company can offer."}

I also believe that trying new things can lead to unexpected rewards.

But eventually, I decided to take the chance and give it a try. I ended up loving it and it was one of the best decisions I ever made. I made new friends, learned new skills, and even got a chance to travel with the team. \n\nTaking risks also helps us to challenge our current beliefs and perspectives. It can help us to see the world from a different point of view and help us to become more open-minded.

I was initially hesitant to join because I thought it was not something I would be interested in. But after attending a few meetings, I realized how rewarding it was to help others and how it made me feel. It was a great learning experience and it made me more compassionate and understanding of different perspectives. \n\nIn conclusion, taking risks and trying something new can be intimidating at first, but it can lead to amazing opportunities, experiences, and even passions.

A business plan should be created outlining the goals, objectives, and strategies for the business. This plan should include a marketing plan, financial plan, and a plan for how to manage any potential risks. Additionally, the business should be researched and analyzed to ensure that it is viable and that there is a market for the product or service.\n\nSuccess in life also comes from hard work. It is important to have a plan, but without putting in the effort to execute that plan, success will be difficult to achieve. Working hard and dedicating time and effort to a task is essential for success. This could mean staying up late to finish a project or waking up early to finish a task before a deadline. It also means being willing to learn from mistakes and to keep trying even when faced with failure.\n\nIn conclusion, success in life comes from careful planning and hard work. Taking risks can be beneficial, but without a plan in place, it is difficult to know if the risks are worth taking.

On the other hand, the automobile has caused a number of problems, such as air pollution, traffic congestion, and a decrease in physical activity. \n\nThe most obvious negative impact of the automobile is air pollution.

On one hand, they have made many tasks easier, such as shopping, communication, and research. We can now order groceries online, stay in touch with friends and family all over the world, and access vast amounts of information with just a few clicks of the mouse. On the other hand, computers have also made life more complex by introducing new problems such as cybercrime, data privacy, and digital addiction. \n\nFor example, cybercrime has become a major issue in the digital age. With the rise of online banking and shopping, criminals have found new ways to steal money and data from unsuspecting victims. This has led to an increase in security measures such as two-factor authentication and encryption, but it has also created a burden for users who must remember multiple passwords and take extra steps to protect their data. \n\nData privacy is another issue that has become more complex with the rise of computers. With the amount of data that is collected and stored by companies, governments, and other organizations, it has become increasingly difficult to keep it secure and private. This has led to the rise of data protection laws and regulations, but it has also created a situation where users must be aware of how their data is being used and shared. \n\nFinally, computers have also made life more complex by creating a new type of addiction. With the rise of online gaming, streaming services, and social media, it has become easier than ever to become addicted to the internet and digital devices. This has led to an increase in mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, as well as physical health issues such as obesity. \n\nIn conclusion, computers have made life easier in many ways, but they have also created new problems such as cybercrime, data privacy, and digital addiction.

Forests are particularly important, as they provide habitats for a wide variety of species, absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and provide a source of timber and other resources. Unfortunately, they are being destroyed at an alarming rate due to human activities such as deforestation, illegal logging, and land conversion. \n\nDeforestation is a major contributor to the loss of forests, as it involves the clearing of trees for agricultural or other development purposes. This can have a devastating effect on the environment, as it reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere, destroys wildlife habitats, and reduces the amount of timber available. In addition, it can lead to soil erosion, flooding, and climate change. \n\nIllegal logging is another major problem, as it is done without regard for the laws and regulations that are designed to protect forests. This type of logging often involves the destruction of large areas of forest, and can lead to the same problems as deforestation. \n\nFinally, land conversion is another factor that contributes to the loss of forests. This occurs when land that was once used for forestry is converted to other uses, such as urban or agricultural development. This can lead to the destruction of large areas of forest, and can reduce the availability of resources such as timber and clean water. \n\nIn conclusion, the world is facing an alarming loss of natural resources, with forests being one of the most vulnerable. Deforestation, illegal logging, and land conversion are all major contributors to this problem, and need to be addressed.

Water pollution, climate change, and overuse are all contributing to the depletion of this precious resource. As a result, many communities are facing water shortages and the consequences of water-related disasters are becoming more frequent and severe. \n\nWater pollution is one of the most pressing issues when it comes to clean water. Human activities such as industrial waste, agricultural runoff, and sewage are all contributing to the contamination of our water sources. This pollution can be harmful to both humans and wildlife, as it can make water unfit for consumption and can lead to the spread of disease. \n\nClimate change is also a major factor in the depletion of clean water. As temperatures rise, snow and ice melts earlier in the spring, reducing the amount of water stored in glaciers and snowpacks. This can lead to droughts and water shortages, as there is less water available for communities to use. \n\nFinally, overuse of water is another factor in the depletion of clean water. As populations grow, so does the demand for water. This can lead to water being used unsustainably, leading to shortages and water-related disasters such as droughts and floods. \n\nWe must take action to save clean water before it is too late. We must reduce water pollution, limit our use of water, and work to reduce the effects of climate change. We must also invest in infrastructure to ensure that clean water is available for future generations. If we do not take action now, we will face a future without clean water.", "esl_essay": "The world is facing an alarming loss of natural resources, with forests, animals, and clean waters being some of the most vulnerable. Forests are particularly vulnerable to destruction due to human activities such as deforestation, which is the removal of trees for various purposes including timber harvesting and land conversion. Deforestation has a range of negative impacts, from loss of habitat for animals and plants, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and decreased water availability. \n\nForests are essential for the environment and human life. They provide habitats for a wide range of species, from endangered species like the Sumatran tiger to the countless species of insects, birds, and plants that are essential for the health of the planet. Forests also help to regulate the climate, as they absorb and store carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, and release oxygen. Additionally, forests are a major source of fresh water, as they help to replenish groundwater and surface water sources. \n\nThe loss of forests is a major problem, and it is essential that we take action to protect them. Governments and citizens must work together to reduce deforestation, through legislation, education, and other means. This can include reducing the demand for products from endangered forests, such as illegal timber, and increasing the availability of sustainable forestry products. Additionally, replanting forests and restoring damaged areas can help to reduce the amount of land that is lost to deforestation. \n\nIn conclusion, the loss of forests is a major problem that affects the environment, animals, and humans.

The average salary for an NBA player is around $7 million per year, which is a substantial amount of money. However, when you consider the amount of money that the league brings in through ticket sales, merchandise, and other sources, the salaries of the players seem more reasonable. For example, the Los Angeles Lakers made over $400 million in 2018, and the average player salary on the team was $21.9 million.

On one hand, preserving old buildings can help to maintain the city's cultural identity and heritage, while also providing a sense of nostalgia for locals and tourists alike. On the other hand, modern buildings can bring more economic growth and provide more efficient uses of space. \n\nFor example, in the city of London, England, the city council is currently considering whether to preserve the iconic Bankside Power Station or to replace it with a new, modern development. The power station has been a landmark in the city since it was built in 1947, but it has become outdated and is in need of costly repairs. The new development would bring more jobs and economic growth to the area, as well as provide more efficient uses of the land. \n\nIn conclusion, while preserving old buildings can be beneficial for maintaining a city's identity and heritage, modern buildings can bring more economic growth and more efficient uses of space.

Old buildings also provide a connection to a city's past, and can be used to educate people on the history of a place. \n\nOn the other hand, modern buildings can provide a city with much-needed infrastructure and amenities. They can be more energy-efficient and provide more space for residents. Modern buildings can also be designed to fit in with the existing architecture of a city, or to provide a unique and striking look that can attract people to the area. \n\nIn conclusion, both old and modern buildings have their advantages and disadvantages. It is important for a city to preserve its historic buildings, but it is also important to consider the needs of the city and its residents.

Positive reinforcement is a powerful tool for encouraging desired behavior and discouraging undesired behavior. When people are praised for their efforts, they are more likely to repeat those efforts in the future. On the other hand, when people are criticized or punished for their actions, they are less likely to repeat those actions in the future. Therefore, it makes sense to focus on praising the behaviors we want to see more of and ignoring the behaviors we want to see less of.\n\nFor example, as an educator, I have found that praising students for their efforts and acknowledging their progress has a much more positive effect than criticizing them for their mistakes. When students are praised for their efforts, they are more likely to stay motivated and engaged in the learning process. On the other hand, when students are criticized for their mistakes, they may become discouraged and lose their motivation.\n\nAs a parent, I have also found that praising my children for their efforts and accomplishments has been much more effective than criticizing them for their mistakes.

It is much more effective to provide constructive feedback and guidance that helps people to understand what they are doing well and how they can improve. This approach also helps to build trust and respect, which are essential components of any successful relationship. \n\nFor example, when I was a teacher, I found that when I praised the students for the work they did well and provided constructive feedback on the areas that needed improvement, they were more willing to take my guidance and were more likely to succeed. This approach also encouraged them to take ownership of their learning and to take pride in their work. \n\nFurthermore, when I was a boss, I found that when I focused on the positive and provided feedback that was tailored to the individual, my team was more motivated and productive.

By questioning what they are being taught, students can gain a better understanding of the material and develop critical thinking skills that will be useful in their future. \n\nFor example, in my high school history class, we were taught a one-sided version of the American Civil War. We were only taught about the battles and the political decisions made by the government, but not the social and economic factors that led up to the war. After I questioned this, my teacher was able to provide me with more information about the context of the war and its causes.

This is especially true for those who are in the public eye, such as celebrities and politicians. \n\nTake, for example, the recent scandals involving high-profile celebrities. In the past, a celebrity could commit a crime or make a mistake and still be forgiven by the public. However, in today\u2019s world, with the prevalence of social media and 24-hour news cycles, any misstep by a celebrity is quickly magnified and discussed in great detail. As a result, it is difficult for any celebrity to maintain a positive reputation for a long period of time. \n\nThe same can be said for politicians.

On the other hand, it can be detrimental to learning in that it can lead to an overly focused and narrow approach to education, where the pursuit of grades becomes the primary goal, rather than the actual learning and understanding of the material.\n\nIn my opinion, the best way to learn is to strike a balance between the two. It is important to have a goal to strive for, but it is also important to take the time to explore and understand the material. This can be done by asking questions, engaging in class discussions, and seeking help from teachers and peers. Doing so allows one to not only gain a better understanding of the material, but also to develop critical thinking skills and gain a deeper appreciation for the subject.\n\nIn conclusion, while striving for top grades can be beneficial, it should not be the only focus when it comes to learning.

By first introducing students to the underlying concepts and ideas, educators can help students better comprehend and retain the facts that are later presented.\n\nFor example, when teaching a unit on the history of World War II, it would be beneficial to first introduce students to the major causes of the war, such as the rise of fascism and the inability of the League of Nations to stop aggressors. By understanding the underlying trends and ideas, students can better comprehend the facts such as the dates and locations of major battles, the number of casualties, and the role of key figures.\n\nFurthermore, this approach can also help students better understand the connections between facts and make more meaningful connections between different topics. For example, when teaching a unit on the history of the United States, it would be beneficial to first introduce students to the major trends in the development of the nation, such as westward expansion and the industrial revolution. By understanding the underlying ideas, students can better comprehend the facts such as the dates and locations of important battles, the number of casualties, and the role of key figures.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that educators should teach facts after their students have studied the ideas, trends, and concepts that help explain those facts.

For example, in matters of healthcare, education, and economic policy, the government should use its expertise to make decisions that are best for the population as a whole, rather than simply following the will of the majority. At the same time, it is important to ensure that the government is accountable to the people, and so officials should be open to feedback and criticism, and make sure that their decisions are in line with the values and interests of the people they represent.", "aae_essay": "I strongly agree with the statement that government officials should trust their own judgment instead of simply following orders from others. This is because government officials are elected by the people and are entrusted with the responsibility of making decisions that are in the best interest of their constituents.

For example, in some countries, the majority of people support a certain policy, but if the government were to implement it, it could lead to economic disaster. Government officials should use their own judgement to make decisions that are in the best interest of the people, not just the majority opinion. \n\nOn the other hand, there are certain circumstances where following the will of the people is beneficial. In some cases, the people have a better understanding of the issues than the government does, and their opinion should be taken into consideration.

On the other hand, setting long-term goals with a plan for how to achieve them can provide a sense of purpose and direction, as well as a sense of accomplishment when the goal is finally reached. \n\nFor example, rather than focusing on becoming a famous celebrity overnight, young people should be encouraged to focus on developing their skills and talents in order to become a successful professional in their chosen field. This could include taking classes, gaining experience through internships or apprenticeships, and networking with people in the industry.

This is especially true for those from marginalized backgrounds who may not have the same access to resources and opportunities as their peers. \n\nFor example, when I was in high school, I had a classmate who was passionate about music but was discouraged from pursuing it because of the lack of resources available to him. He was told that he would never make it big and that he should focus on more practical goals instead. This was a huge loss for the community, as he had the potential to be a great musician. \n\nOn the other hand, I had another classmate who was encouraged to pursue her dream of becoming a doctor.

Positive reinforcement is a powerful tool for encouraging desired behavior and discouraging undesired behavior. When people are praised for their efforts, they are more likely to repeat those efforts in the future.

It also helps to build self-confidence and a sense of accomplishment when people are praised for the things they do well. \n\nFor example, when teaching a child how to play a musical instrument, it is important to focus on the things they do correctly and praise them for those. This will help them to build their confidence and keep them motivated to practice. If we only focus on the things they do wrong, it will be discouraging and they may give up. \n\nFurthermore, when we focus on the positive, it allows us to recognize the individual for their unique talents and abilities. Everyone is different and has different strengths and weaknesses, so it is important to recognize and celebrate these differences. When we focus on the negative, it can be easy to overlook these differences and the potential that each person has. \n\nIn conclusion, the best way to teach is to focus on the positive and not the negative.

On the other hand, when students are criticized for their mistakes, they may become discouraged and lose their enthusiasm for learning. \n\nFor example, when a student is learning how to write a paper, it is important to praise the student for the structure and content of the paper, even if it is not perfect. This will encourage the student to keep trying and to understand what elements are necessary for a successful paper. However, if the student makes mistakes such as grammar and spelling errors, it is important to focus on those and provide constructive feedback. This will help the student to understand what needs to be done to improve the paper, rather than focusing on the negative and discouraging the student. \n\nIn conclusion, praising positive actions and ignoring the negative ones is the most effective way to teach.

While it is true that many great ideas and inventions have come about as a result of accidental discoveries, it is important to note that these discoveries are often the result of careful observation and analysis of the environment and the willingness to explore and experiment with different ideas. For example, the discovery of penicillin was the result of Alexander Fleming's observation that a culture of bacteria was killed by a mold that had contaminated his experiment. Similarly, the invention of the light bulb was the result of Thomas Edison's careful experimentation with different materials and designs. Thus, while it is true that many great discoveries have been made by accident, it is also true that these discoveries are the result of careful observation, experimentation, and analysis.", "aae_essay": "I definitely agree with the statement that big finds or discoveries often happen by chance. In my own life, I have experienced this many times. For example, when I was studying for a test in college, I was trying to learn a particular concept but I was struggling to understand it. During this time, I stumbled upon a related topic that I found interesting and decided to research it. As I was researching, I eventually came across an explanation of the concept I was originally struggling with and it all clicked. This experience taught me that sometimes when you are looking for one thing, you can find something else that is equally valuable or even more so.\n\nI believe this phenomenon is especially true in the field of research and discovery. Scientists and researchers often stumble upon new and unexpected results when they are looking for something else. For example, when Marie Curie was researching the properties of a new element, she discovered the element's two new properties in addition to the one she was originally looking for. This is a testament to the fact that big finds often happen by chance.\n\nI believe that this phenomenon is a reminder to remain open-minded and not be too focused on the end result. When we are open to exploring related topics and ideas, we can often find something even more valuable than what we were originally looking for.", "esl_essay": "I agree with the statement that many important discoveries or creations are accidental. Innovation often comes from unexpected places, and it is often the case that the more we explore a certain area, the more we discover. For example, the invention of the internet was not the result of a single individual sitting down and trying to create a global network; it was the result of a series of accidents and coincidences that eventually led to the development of the internet as we know it today. Similarly, the discovery of penicillin was not the result of a planned experiment; it was the result of a series of unrelated experiments that led to the accidental discovery of the antibiotic. \n\nThe statement is also true in the sense that many discoveries or creations are the result of a combination of different ideas and concepts. For example, the invention of the airplane was not the result of a single individual coming up with the idea of a flying machine; it was the result of a series of ideas and experiments that eventually led to the first successful powered flight. Similarly, the development of the computer was not the result of a single individual inventing a machine that could store and process information; it was the result of a combination of ideas and experiments that eventually led to the development of the modern computer. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe that many important discoveries or creations are accidental, as they often come about as a result of exploration and experimentation. It is only through this process that we can make new and exciting advancements in our understanding of the world and our place in it."}

Leaders are often thrust into positions of authority due to the needs of the moment, and they must rise to the occasion in order to meet those demands.

In this way, leaders are often created by the challenges they face and the situations they are forced to navigate. \n\nAt the same time, leaders can also create their own opportunities by recognizing and seizing upon the needs of their followers.

It is true that leaders get made by what they gotta handle, as the experiences they have and the decisions they make in challenging times shape the type of leader they become. Leaders must be able to think on their feet and make decisions that are in the best interest of their team or organization. This is especially true in times of crisis, when a leader must be able to remain calm, think strategically, and inspire their team to reach their goals.\n\nI believe that leaders get made by what they gotta handle because of the lessons that are learned from difficult situations. When faced with a challenge, a leader must be able to assess the situation, think critically, and come up with a plan of action. This requires a leader to be decisive and think strategically. A leader must also be able to communicate their plan of action to their team and motivate them to work together towards a common goal. This is when a leader's true leadership skills are put to the test.\n\nI have seen this concept of leaders getting made by what they gotta handle play out in my own life. In my previous job, I was part of a team that was tasked with a difficult project. We had a tight timeline and a lot of pressure to deliver a successful product. Through our hard work and dedication, we were able to complete the project on time and within the budget. This experience taught me the importance of being able to handle difficult situations and how to lead a team to success.\n\nIn conclusion, leaders get made by what they gotta handle. Leaders must be able to think on their feet, make difficult decisions, and lead their team to success. This is only possible by learning from difficult situations and developing the skills to handle them.", "esl_essay": "I agree with the statement that leaders are created by the demands placed on them. Leaders are people who are able to rise up and meet the challenges of their environment, whether it be through their own initiative or in response to the requests of those around them. Leaders are often those who are able to identify problems and come up with solutions, or who are able to take a vision and make it a reality. They are the ones who are willing to take risks and stand up for what they believe in, even if it means facing opposition. Leaders are not born, they are made, and they are made by the demands of their environment."}

We must take action to protect endangered species, not only for their own sake, but for the sake of the ecosystems and habitats they are a part of. \n\nThe loss of a single species can have far-reaching consequences for the environment. For example, the extinction of a species can disrupt the delicate balance of an ecosystem, leading to a decrease in biodiversity and the loss of other species. Additionally, the loss of a species can also affect the resources and services that it provides to humans, such as pollination and nutrient cycling. \n\nFurthermore, the loss of a species can also have a significant emotional and spiritual impact on people. Many cultures and societies have a deep connection to and respect for the natural world, and the loss of a species can be seen as a loss of a part of their heritage and identity. \n\nGiven the importance of species to our planet and the potential consequences of their extinction, it is clear that society has a responsibility to take action to protect them.

We should prioritize our resources and focus on the most pressing issues first. We should also consider the potential consequences of our actions, such as job losses, before taking drastic measures. \n\nThe cost of saving endangered species is high. It costs millions of dollars to protect endangered species, and this money could be better spent on more pressing issues. For example, the cost of protecting the Florida panther alone is estimated to be $200 million over the next decade. This money could be used to address more urgent needs such as poverty, hunger, and lack of access to healthcare. \n\nFurthermore, the risk of job losses should not be taken lightly. Many people depend on the industries that are affected by conservation efforts, such as hunting and fishing, and these jobs should not be put at risk without careful consideration. For example, the closure of a hunting area can have a devastating effect on the local economy, as hunters are no longer able to provide for their families. \n\nIn conclusion, while protecting endangered species is important, the current level of spending and risk-taking to do so is excessive and should be re-evaluated.

This is true for both positive and negative attitudes. \n\nOn the other hand, society as a whole can have an influence on people's attitudes. For example, certain attitudes that are seen as acceptable in one society may not be accepted in another. This can shape the attitudes of the people in those societies. Additionally, certain events or trends in society can shape the attitudes of people. For example, the #MeToo movement has caused people to become more aware of issues of sexual harassment and assault, and this has likely shaped people's attitudes on the matter. \n\nOverall, I believe that people's attitudes are shaped by both their immediate surroundings and society as a whole.", "aae_essay": "I believe that people's mindsets are shaped more by what is going on around them than by the whole society. This is because people are influenced by their environment, and the people and experiences that they interact with on a daily basis have a greater impact on their beliefs and perspectives than the culture or media at large. \n\nFor example, if a person is surrounded by people who are supportive and encouraging, they are more likely to have a positive outlook on life and be optimistic about their future. On the other hand, if a person is surrounded by people who are negative and pessimistic, they will be more likely to adopt those same attitudes. This is why it is important for people to be mindful of the people they surround themselves with, as they can have a significant influence on their outlook. \n\nIn addition, people are also influenced by their experiences. For example, if a person has a positive experience with a certain activity or concept, they are more likely to be open to trying other similar activities or ideas. On the other hand, if a person has a negative experience with something, they are less likely to be open to trying it again in the future. This is why it is important to be mindful of the experiences we have and the lessons we take away from them. \n\nOverall, I believe that people's mindsets are shaped more by what is going on around them than by the whole society.

For example, if a person is surrounded by people who have a certain attitude or belief, they are likely to adopt that attitude or belief as their own. This is especially true when it comes to matters of opinion, as people are more likely to agree with others when it comes to matters of opinion than when it comes to matters of fact. \n\nOn the other hand, society as a whole can have an influence on people's attitudes.

Arts funding is essential for a healthy and vibrant society, and its benefits extend far beyond economic growth. The arts provide a means of expression and creativity that is essential for a healthy and balanced population, and can provide a much-needed outlet for people to explore their emotions and creativity. Furthermore, the arts are a major source of employment and economic growth, as the arts industry is a major contributor to the economy. \n\nFurthermore, the arts can also be a powerful tool for social cohesion and understanding. Arts programs can provide a platform for people from different backgrounds to come together and learn from each other, and can help to bridge divides between different communities. In addition, the arts can be a powerful tool for teaching and learning, as they can help to engage students in learning in a more meaningful way. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe that suspending arts funding during times of economic difficulty is not the right solution.

The arts are a major industry, generating over $700 billion in economic activity annually. This activity supports jobs in the arts, as well as jobs in other industries such as hospitality, retail, and tourism. Additionally, the arts are a major source of tax revenue for cities and states. \n\nFinally, the arts are important for our mental and physical health. Research has shown that engaging in the arts can reduce stress, improve cognitive skills, and even help with physical rehabilitation. \n\nIn conclusion, the government should not stop putting money into the arts when there are people out there who are starving or unemployed. The arts provide too much value to our society and our economy to be ignored.", "esl_essay": "I strongly disagree with the recommendation that nations should suspend government funding for the arts when there is a significant number of citizens who are hungry or unemployed. The arts are an essential part of a nation\u2019s culture and identity, and cutting funding for the arts would be detrimental to its citizens. The arts provide a way for people to express themselves, to explore their creativity, and to develop their critical thinking skills. Furthermore, the arts can be a major source of employment and economic growth, as it has been proven that investing in the arts can lead to increased tourism and economic development. \n\nFurthermore, the arts can be a source of hope and inspiration in difficult times. During the Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) was created to provide jobs for artists, writers, musicians, and other creatives, which helped to lift people\u2019s spirits and provide them with a sense of purpose. In addition, the arts can be used to educate people on important topics, such as history, science, and current events. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe that cutting funding for the arts is not the answer to a nation\u2019s economic struggles. The arts are too important to the identity and wellbeing of a nation\u2019s citizens to be ignored or cut back on during difficult times."}

Facts are important, but they are only the starting point for understanding. It is the ability to analyze, synthesize, and apply knowledge that is the true measure of learning. Facts can be easily memorized, but understanding requires thought and analysis.\n\nFor example, in a history class, a student may be able to recite the dates and places of major battles in a war, but if they cannot explain the causes of the war or the impact of the battles on the course of the war, then their understanding of the material is limited. Similarly, in a science class, a student may be able to accurately recite the steps of the scientific method, but if they cannot explain how the scientific method is used to solve problems and explore the natural world, then their understanding of the material is incomplete.\n\nAssessing students on their ability to explain the ideas, trends, and concepts that the facts illustrate is a more meaningful way to measure learning.

For example, a student may know the periodic table of elements but if they cannot explain how the elements interact with each other, then their knowledge is not as valuable as it could be.\n\nIn my experience, this is especially important in the classroom. When students are presented with a new concept, it is important for them to be able to break down the concept into its component parts and analyze how the parts fit together. This allows them to better understand the concept and also helps them to better remember it. For example, when teaching a student about the human digestive system, it is important for them to be able to identify the different organs and their functions, as well as how the organs interact with each other to complete the process of digestion.\n\nIn addition, being able to break down complex ideas into simpler parts can help students better understand the material and make connections between different topics. For example, when teaching a student about the history of World War II, it is important for them to be able to understand the causes of the war and the events that led up to it, as well as the global impact of the war.

This is especially true for those in the public eye, such as politicians and celebrities, who have the power to shape public opinion. \n\nThis phenomenon has become so pervasive that it has even begun to influence our daily lives. People are increasingly making decisions based on what they think will make them look good, rather than what is actually true or right. This can be seen in the way people present themselves online, the way they dress, the way they speak, and the way they interact with others. It has become increasingly important to be seen as a certain type of person, and people will go to great lengths to achieve that image. \n\nThe consequences of this phenomenon are far-reaching.

Social media has created a culture of comparison and perfection, where people feel the need to present themselves in the best light possible. This can lead to unhealthy habits such as over-exercising, over-photographing oneself, and over-filtering images. This is especially damaging for young people who are still forming their self-images and may be more susceptible to the pressure to look a certain way.\n\nAt the same time, there are some positive aspects to this trend. People are becoming more aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing, and are recognizing the need to prioritize this over physical appearance. There is also a growing movement of people who are rejecting the idea of perfection and embracing their individuality.\n\nOverall, while the emphasis on looks is a problem, it is also an opportunity to raise awareness of the importance of mental health and to celebrate individuality.

In many aspects of life, from business to politics to entertainment, people are more focused on creating an attractive image than on presenting the truth.

They may use deceptive editing to make it seem as if they are taking a strong stance on an issue when in reality they may be much more moderate. This type of manipulation is becoming increasingly common and is a major factor in why people have such low levels of trust in their government. \n\nIn the business world, companies are also using image manipulation to their advantage. Companies often use slick advertisements and carefully crafted press releases to make it seem as if they are doing more for the environment or for their customers than they actually are. This type of deception is becoming increasingly common and is eroding the trust that people have in businesses. \n\nIn conclusion, creating an appealing image is becoming increasingly important in today's society, and this is leading to a lack of trust in many aspects of life.

Furthermore, a good leadership will also create an environment that encourages businesses to thrive, while a bad leadership will create an environment that is hostile to businesses and stifles economic growth. \n\nOverall, a country's leadership can be judged by looking at how its people are living. A good leadership will create an environment that allows citizens to live a better life, while a bad leadership will create an environment that leads to poverty and misery.", "esl_essay": "I agree with the statement that the effectivity of a country's leaders can be measured by examining the well-being of its citizens. Leaders are responsible for creating and implementing policies that will have a direct impact on the lives of their citizens, so it is important to evaluate the results of these policies. Measuring the well-being of a country's citizens is one way to evaluate the effectivity of a country's leaders. \n\nFor example, a country's GDP per capita is a good indicator of a country's overall economic well-being. If a country has a high GDP per capita, it means that its citizens are able to enjoy a higher standard of living, with access to better healthcare, education, and other public services. Additionally, a country with a high GDP per capita also indicates that its citizens are able to purchase goods and services, which helps to stimulate the economy and create jobs. \n\nFurthermore, a country's poverty rate is another important factor to consider when evaluating the effectivity of its leaders. A country with a low poverty rate indicates that its citizens are able to meet their basic needs and enjoy a higher quality of life. Additionally, a low poverty rate also indicates that the country is able to provide its citizens with access to necessary social services and safety nets. \n\nIn conclusion, examining the well-being of a country's citizens is an effective way to measure the effectivity of its leaders. A country with a high GDP per capita, low poverty rate, and access to necessary social services and safety nets indicates that its leaders are effective in creating and implementing policies that benefit its citizens."}

Technology can be a great tool for learning, but it can also be a major distraction. In many cases, students are more focused on playing around with the technology than they are on the task at hand. This can be especially true for students who are more comfortable with technology than with traditional methods of learning. \n\nFurthermore, technology can be a major distraction for both teachers and students. Technology can be a great way to enhance learning, but it can also be a major distraction. For example, in classrooms with computers, students may be more focused on playing games or using social media than they are on listening to the teacher. This can lead to students not getting the most out of their education. \n\nIn addition, technology can be expensive and difficult to maintain. Schools often have to invest a lot of money in technology in order to keep up with the latest trends, and then they have to spend even more money to keep the technology running and up to date. This can be a major burden for schools that are already struggling to make ends meet. \n\nOverall, I believe that technology can be a great tool for learning, but it can also be a major distraction and a financial burden for schools. It is important for schools to use technology wisely and judiciously in order to get the most out of it.", "esl_essay": "I agree with the statement that innovations like video, computer, and the Internet can often distract students from real learning. While these technologies can provide engaging and interactive learning experiences, they can also be a major distraction and cause students to lose focus. For example, the use of computers and the Internet can easily lead to procrastination and multitasking, which can be detrimental to learning. Additionally, the use of video and other visual aids can be so captivating that it can be difficult for students to stay focused on the material. \n\nFurthermore, these technologies can also be a source of cheating. With the use of the Internet, it is easy for students to look up answers to questions or to plagiarize information from other sources. This can lead to students not learning the material themselves and not gaining the skills and knowledge they need to be successful. \n\nIn conclusion, while these technologies can be beneficial for learning, they can also be a major distraction and lead to students not learning the material they need to. It is important for students to be able to use these technologies responsibly and for teachers to be aware of the potential distractions they can cause."}

While it is important to take into account the opinions of the people when making decisions, it is also important to consider the long-term effects of the decision and to make sure that it is in line with the best interests of the country. \n\nFor example, in some cases, the people may want a certain policy enacted, but it may not be in the best interests of the country. In this case, it is the responsibility of the government to make the decision that is best for the country, regardless of the people\u2019s opinion. Similarly, if a decision is made that is not popular with the people, it is important that the government is able to explain their reasoning and stand by their decision. \n\nIn conclusion, while it is important to take into account the opinions of the people when making decisions, it is the responsibility of the government to make decisions that are in the best interests of the country, and it is essential that these decisions are based on careful consideration and analysis, rather than simply following the popular opinion of the people."}

By investing in the health of the communities and the world, big companies can create a positive impact and make the world a better place. \n\nAt the same time, I recognize that businesses must also look out for their own interests. Companies must make sure that they are staying within the law and making profits in order to survive and grow. They must also make decisions that are in the best interests of their shareholders and stakeholders. \n\nHowever, I believe that businesses can and should balance their own interests with the interests of the community and the world. Companies should strive to be responsible corporate citizens and to create a positive impact in the world. By investing in the health of the communities and the world, big companies can create a better future for everyone.", "esl_essay": "I believe that corporations have a responsibility to promote the well-being of the societies and environments where they operate. This is because corporations have the resources and power to make a positive impact in these areas, and it is only fair that they use their resources for the greater good. Corporations should strive to create value for their stakeholders, including the communities in which they are based, and this should be a priority for the company. \n\nFor example, corporations can create jobs and economic growth in the areas where they are based. This can help to reduce poverty and create a healthier, more prosperous society. Additionally, corporations can invest in environmental projects that reduce pollution and protect natural resources. This can help to ensure that future generations can enjoy a healthy and clean environment. \n\nFurthermore, corporations should be held accountable for their actions. They should be transparent and responsible in their dealings with stakeholders, and they should ensure that their operations are ethical and legal. This will help to build trust with the communities in which they are based, and it will also help to protect the environment and other stakeholders. \n\nIn conclusion, corporations have a responsibility to promote the well-being of the societies and environments where they operate. This is because they have the resources and power to make a positive impact, and it is only fair that they use their resources for the greater good."}

It can also lead to students feeling overwhelmed or discouraged if they don't perform as well as their peers. \n\nIn my opinion, the key to making sure that competition does not limit learning is to ensure that students are not only competing with each other, but also with themselves. Students should be encouraged to set goals for themselves and to challenge themselves to do better than they did before. This will help them to focus on their own learning and to push themselves to understand the material more deeply. Additionally, teachers should provide support and guidance to students who are struggling and make sure that no student is left behind. This will help to ensure that all students are able to reach their full potential."}

For example, a nation may have a great scientist who makes a breakthrough in a certain field, but if that breakthrough is not sustained and the nation does not continue to make progress in that field, then the accomplishment is not as meaningful or beneficial to the nation. \n\nFurthermore, the accomplishments of a nation\u2019s leaders, artists, and scientists often do not reflect the values and aspirations of the nation as a whole. For example, a nation may have a great scientist who has made a breakthrough in a certain field, but if the nation\u2019s citizens do not share the same values or aspirations as the scientist, then the accomplishment is not as meaningful or beneficial to the nation. Additionally, the accomplishments of a nation\u2019s leaders, artists, and scientists often do not reflect the needs and desires of the majority of the nation\u2019s citizens. For example, a nation may have a great scientist who has made a breakthrough in a certain field, but if the majority of the nation\u2019s citizens do not have access to the resources or opportunities to benefit from the breakthrough, then the accomplishment is not as meaningful or beneficial to the nation. \n\nIn conclusion, the overall well-being of a nation is a better indicator of its greatness than the accomplishments of its leaders, artists, and scientists. The accomplishments of a nation\u2019s leaders, artists, and scientists are often limited to a specific field or area, while the overall well-being of a nation reflects its progress in all areas. Furthermore, the accomplishments of a nation\u2019s leaders, artists, and scientists often do not reflect the values and aspirations of the nation as a whole, nor do they reflect the needs and desires of the majority of the nation\u2019s citizens. Therefore, the overall well-being of a nation is a better indicator of its greatness than the accomplishments of its leaders, artists, and scientists.", "esl_essay": "I agree with the statement that the general welfare of a nation's people is a better indicator of its greatness than the achievements of its rulers, artists, and scientists. The reason for this is that the wellbeing of a nation's people is the result of the collective efforts of all its citizens, regardless of their profession. The achievements of its rulers, artists, and scientists are the result of the resources and opportunities provided by the nation's people. Therefore, the general welfare of the people is a better measure of a nation's greatness. \n\nFor example, consider two nations with identical GDPs, but vastly different levels of social welfare. If one nation has a high rate of poverty, lack of access to healthcare, and high unemployment, while the other nation has a low rate of poverty, universal healthcare, and high employment, it is clear that the second nation is the greater nation, despite having a lower GDP. This is because the welfare of the people is a better measure of a nation's greatness than its economic achievements. \n\nIn conclusion, the general welfare of a nation's people is a better indicator of its greatness than the achievements of its rulers, artists, and scientists."}

Consumer-generated waste is a major contributor to environmental pollution, and the only way to effectively combat this problem is to reduce the amount of waste being produced in the first place. By setting limits on the amount of waste households can produce, towns and cities can create an incentive for people to reduce their consumption and wasteful habits. This will lead to a decrease in the amount of waste being sent to landfills and incinerators, which will in turn help to reduce the environmental damage caused by consumer-generated waste.", "aae_essay": "I believe that implementing stricter regulations on the amount of waste that families are allowed to dispose of is an effective way to tackle environmental issues caused by overconsumption. \n\nFirstly, the amount of waste produced by households is a major contributor to environmental degradation. According to the World Bank, over 8 million tonnes of plastic waste were dumped into the ocean in 2018 alone. This is just one example of the vast amount of waste that is being produced and it is having a detrimental effect on our environment. \n\nSecondly, households are not the only ones responsible for this waste production. Businesses and industries are also major contributors. For example, the fashion industry is one of the largest polluters in the world, with over 100 billion garments being produced annually. This is unsustainable and is having a negative impact on the environment. \n\nThirdly, the amount of waste that is being produced is not being properly managed.

Consumer-generated waste is a major contributor to environmental pollution, and strict limits on waste acceptance can help reduce this pollution. For example, in the United States, the EPA estimates that over 80 million tons of plastic waste were recycled in 2018, which is a significant reduction from the amount of plastic waste that would have ended up in landfills. Additionally, strict limits on waste acceptance can help encourage people to reduce their consumption of single-use items, which can also help reduce environmental pollution. \n\nFurthermore, imposing limits on waste acceptance can help towns and cities save money. For example, in 2018, the city of San Francisco saved over $30 million by reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills. This money can be used to fund other city services, such as public transportation or infrastructure improvements. \n\nIn conclusion, imposing strict limits on waste acceptance from households is an effective way to reduce consumer-generated waste and its associated environmental pollution.

We may become content with our current situation and fail to challenge ourselves to reach higher goals. \n\nFor example, when we fail at something, we often become more determined to succeed in the future. We learn from our mistakes and use that knowledge to improve our skills and understanding. However, when we succeed, we may become complacent and think that we have arrived. This can lead to a lack of motivation to strive for further growth and development. We may become content with our current situation and fail to challenge ourselves to reach higher goals. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe that it is through our struggles that we learn our most valuable lessons in life, rather than from enjoying our successes.", "aae_essay": "I believe that the best way to learn is through struggle, not just through success. We often think that success is the key to learning, but I believe that it is our struggles that teach us the most. When we face struggles, we must use our creativity and determination to find solutions and figure out ways to overcome them. This forces us to think critically and come up with innovative solutions that we can use to tackle future challenges. We learn from our mistakes and our successes, and this helps us to become better problem solvers and thinkers.\n\nFor example, when I was learning how to program, I faced many struggles. I had to learn a new language and figure out how to apply it to coding. I had to stay focused and determined to keep trying and eventually I was able to figure out the solutions to the problems I faced. I also had to learn from my mistakes and figure out how to adjust my approach to coding. This process of trial and error helped me to become a better programmer and develop my problem-solving skills.\n\nI believe that our struggles are what make us stronger and help us to become better learners. We learn from our successes, but it is our struggles that teach us the most. We must embrace our struggles and use them to become better learners and problem solvers.", "esl_essay": "I agree with the statement that we learn our most valuable lessons in life from struggle with our limitations rather than from enjoying our successes. Our limitations provide us with the opportunity to challenge ourselves and to grow as individuals. We can learn to push ourselves beyond our comfort zones and discover new strengths and abilities. We can also learn to appreciate the value of perseverance and resilience. In addition, when we fail or make mistakes, we can learn to accept our shortcomings and use them as opportunities to learn and grow. \n\nFor example, when I was younger, I was a competitive swimmer and I often found myself frustrated when I didn't win races. I would get caught up in the moment and focus on the results rather than the process. However, when I look back on those experiences, I realize that I learned more from the struggles and mistakes I made in those races than I did from the victories. I learned to push myself harder and to focus on the process rather than the outcome. I also learned to accept my own limitations and to use them as an opportunity to challenge myself. \n\nIn addition, I have found that the most valuable lessons in life often come from the difficult times. When I was in college, I was struggling to find my place and purpose. I was uncertain of what I wanted to do with my life and I felt like I was just going through the motions. It was during this time that I learned to appreciate the value of hard work and dedication. I worked hard to find my passion and to develop my skills, and eventually I found a career that I am passionate about. \n\nOverall, I believe that our limitations provide us with the opportunity to challenge ourselves and to grow as individuals.

Additionally, teachers must be able to provide a safe and supportive environment for students to take risks and ask questions. This requires a teacher to be patient, understanding, and willing to go the extra mile to help a student understand a concept.\n\nAt the same time, teachers must also set high expectations for their students and provide structure and guidance. This includes providing clear objectives and deadlines, as well as providing feedback and guidance on how to improve.

Scandals can also be used to draw attention to important issues that would otherwise be ignored, such as the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster which was brought to light by the cover-up of the Japanese government. \n\nIn conclusion, scandals can be a powerful tool for exposing issues that would otherwise go unnoticed and can be a powerful force for social and political change.", "esl_essay": "I agree with the statement that scandals can be useful in focusing our attention on problems that no speaker or reformer ever could. Scandals have the power to shock the public into action, forcing us to confront issues that would otherwise be ignored or pushed aside. For example, the recent Covid-19 pandemic has brought to light the need for better healthcare systems, public safety measures, and economic policies, all of which were previously neglected due to the lack of a scandal. \n\nScandals can also be a powerful tool for reformers. By exposing a problem, scandals can help reformers identify solutions and push for change. For example, the #MeToo movement was born out of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, and it has since led to a wave of reforms in the entertainment industry and beyond. \n\nHowever, scandals can also be damaging and counterproductive if they are not handled correctly. Scandals can be used to distract from more important issues, or they can be used to manipulate public opinion for personal gain. It is important to be mindful of the potential consequences of scandals and to ensure that they are not used to further entrench existing power dynamics."}

It is important to consider both the potential positive and negative outcomes before implementing this policy.", "esl_essay": "Governments should offer a free university education to any student who has been admitted to a university but who cannot afford the tuition fees. This policy would provide an invaluable opportunity for students from all backgrounds to access the education they need to reach their full potential. It would open up access to higher education for those who would otherwise be unable to afford it, and would help to create a more equitable society.\n\nThe cost of university tuition fees can be prohibitively expensive, and this can act as a barrier to accessing higher education for many people. Those from lower-income backgrounds are particularly affected, as they may not have the financial means to cover the costs of tuition and living expenses. This can lead to a cycle of inequality, as those from poorer backgrounds are denied access to the same opportunities as their wealthier peers.\n\nOffering a free university education would help to break down this barrier and ensure that all students have access to the same quality of education, regardless of their background. This would lead to a more equitable society, where everyone has the same opportunities to reach their full potential.\n\nFurthermore, a free university education would benefit the economy as a whole. By investing in the education of its citizens, a government is investing in its future workforce. A well-educated population is essential for economic growth and development, as it leads to a more productive and innovative society.\n\nIn conclusion, governments should offer a free university education to any student who has been admitted to a university but who cannot afford the tuition fees. This policy would provide an invaluable opportunity for students from all backgrounds to access the education they need to reach their full potential, and would help to create a more equitable society.

On the other hand, emotional appeals rely on the individual\u2019s personal feelings and experiences, which can be subjective and unreliable. They may be effective in the short-term, but they do not have the same staying power as facts.\n\nFurthermore, facts are more effective because they can be backed up with evidence and data.

This is because compromise can often be short-sighted and lead to short-term gains at the expense of long-term progress. By remaining steadfast to their principles, leaders can create a vision for the future and inspire others to follow them in pursuit of that vision. This is especially important in times of crisis, when compromise may be tempting but could lead to a weakening of principles and a lack of direction. \n\nFurthermore, compromise can be a slippery slope. Once a leader starts to compromise on certain principles, it can be difficult to draw the line and determine where to draw the compromise. This can lead to a lack of consistency and trust from the public, who may not know what to expect from their leader. On the other hand, when a leader remains steadfast to their principles, they can build trust and credibility with their constituents. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe that an effective political leader should remain consistently committed to particular principles and objectives, rather than yielding to public opinion and abandoning principle for the sake of compromise.

This is because in order to be successful, a leader must understand the wants and needs of their constituents. If a leader is too rigid in their beliefs, they will not be able to effectively represent their people and will not be able to make progress. However, this does not mean that a leader should abandon their core values or principles. Rather, a leader should be willing to negotiate and make compromises in order to find a solution that is acceptable to all parties. \n\nFor example, when President Obama was negotiating with the Republican-controlled Congress to pass the Affordable Care Act, he had to make compromises to get the bill passed. He had to make sure that the bill included provisions that both sides could agree on, while still achieving his goal of providing healthcare to all. By being willing to negotiate and make compromises, he was able to pass the bill and provide healthcare to millions of Americans. \n\nOn the other hand, there are times when a leader must stand their ground and stick to their principles. This is especially true when it comes to issues of morality and justice. For example, when Martin Luther King Jr. was leading the civil rights movement, he had to stand his ground and refuse to compromise when it came to issues of racial justice and equality. He knew that if he did not, the movement would not have been successful. \n\nIn conclusion, a leader must be willing to bend to the will of the people in order to make a deal, but they must also be willing to stand their ground and stick to their principles when necessary. By understanding when to compromise and when to stand firm, a leader can be effective in leading their constituents and achieving success.", "esl_essay": "I believe that an effective political leader should remain committed to their principles and objectives, regardless of the public opinion. This is because, in order to lead effectively, a leader must be able to make difficult decisions and stand by them. If a leader is willing to compromise their principles for the sake of public opinion, then they will not be able to make the tough decisions that are necessary to lead their constituents effectively. \n\nOn the other hand, it is also important for a leader to be able to understand and take into account the public opinion. A leader must be able to understand the needs and wants of their constituents in order to represent them effectively. Therefore, an effective leader must be able to compromise their principles in order to find a solution that is acceptable to both the public and themselves. \n\nIn conclusion, an effective leader must be able to remain committed to their principles while also understanding and taking into account the public opinion.

Second, the needs of the present are often more urgent and pressing than the needs of the future, and it is important to prioritize the needs of those who are suffering now. Third, solving immediate problems can often provide short-term benefits that outweigh the costs of addressing them, while the same may not be true of future problems. \n\nFor example, governments should focus on addressing the immediate needs of those affected by natural disasters, such as providing food, shelter, and medical care. This is especially true in the case of unexpected disasters, such as pandemics, where the scope and severity of the problem is not yet known. Similarly, governments should focus on addressing the immediate needs of those affected by economic downturns, such as providing job security and financial aid. \n\nOn the other hand, governments should not prioritize solving anticipated problems that may or may not arise in the future.

Therefore, governments should be taking steps now to reduce emissions and protect the environment. \n\nIn addition, governments should be addressing issues such as poverty, inequality, and lack of access to basic services. Poverty and inequality are major issues in many countries, and if left unchecked, can lead to social unrest and further economic decline.

Seeing challenges as opportunities allows us to remain focused on the task, as well as gain insight into how we can grow and develop in order to meet the challenge. \n\nFor example, when facing a difficult exam, instead of simply reimagining the challenge as a hurdle to jump over, we can view it as an opportunity to learn more and grow as a student. We can use the challenge to motivate us to study harder and become better prepared for the exam. We can also use the challenge to help us develop better study habits and better time management skills. By reframing the challenge in this way, we can take a proactive approach to the challenge and use it to our advantage. \n\nIn contrast, reimagining a challenge can be a distraction. It can be easy to become overwhelmed by thoughts of how to reimagine the challenge and lose focus on the task at hand. It can also be difficult to come up with creative solutions when we are already overwhelmed. Additionally, reimagining a challenge can be a way of avoiding the challenge altogether, rather than facing it head on. \n\nOverall, I believe that viewing challenges as opportunities for personal growth is the more effective and realistic approach.

This assumption is based on the premise that a shorter work shift will allow employees to get adequate amounts of sleep, thereby eliminating fatigue and sleep deprivation as contributing factors to accidents. However, this assumption may not be accurate. Other factors, such as inadequate training, inadequate safety measures, or even personal factors such as distraction or carelessness, could also contribute to on-the-job accidents and should be considered. Additionally, even if shortening the work shifts reduces fatigue and sleep deprivation, it may not necessarily lead to a decrease in on-the-job accidents, as there are likely other factors at play. Therefore, the argument presented does not adequately consider all the potential causes of on-the-job accidents and the implications of shortening the work shifts, and so the conclusion should not be accepted without further investigation.", "aae_essay": "The memo from the VP of Quiot Manufacturing suggests that reducing the work shifts from three to two would reduce accidents and increase productivity. This argument is based on the assumption that fatigue is a major cause of accidents in the workplace and that cutting the work shifts will lead to more rest for workers, resulting in fewer accidents and more productivity. \n\nThe first assumption is that fatigue is a major cause of accidents in the workplace. While fatigue can impair cognitive and physical performance, it is not the only factor that contributes to accidents. Other factors such as distractions, lack of training, and inadequate safety measures can also contribute to accidents. Therefore, reducing work shifts alone may not necessarily reduce accidents. \n\nThe second assumption is that cutting the work shifts will lead to more rest for workers. While reducing work shifts may lead to more rest, it may not necessarily result in more rest than what is currently being provided. Workers may still be required to work long hours and may not have enough time to rest. Additionally, reducing work shifts may lead to fewer hours of work, which could result in reduced income for workers. \n\nIn conclusion, the memo from the VP of Quiot Manufacturing is based on two assumptions that may not necessarily be true. While reducing work shifts may lead to more rest for workers, it may not necessarily reduce accidents and may result in reduced income for workers. Therefore, more research is needed to determine the best approach to reducing accidents in the workplace.", "esl_essay": "The argument presented in the memo assumes that fatigue and sleep deprivation are the primary causes of on-the-job accidents at Quiot Manufacturing and that shortening the work shifts will reduce the number of accidents. This assumption is based on the premise that a longer work shift leads to increased fatigue and sleep deprivation, which in turn leads to more on-the-job accidents. However, this argument does not take into account any other potential causes of on-the-job accidents, such as inadequate training, inadequate safety measures, or inadequate supervision. Furthermore, it is possible that shortening the work shifts may not actually reduce the number of on-the-job accidents, as other factors may be at play. Therefore, the argument is based on a flawed assumption and the implications of the argument are questionable."}

Additionally, the price of clothing has increased in the past five years, which should lead to higher prices for alpaca overcoats and increased company profits.\n\nTo evaluate this argument, evidence should be presented that shows the reliability of the new fabric supplier and the current demand for alpaca overcoats. Additionally, evidence should be presented that shows the current prices of other types of clothing and the potential customer base for the alpaca overcoat.

This is supported by the fact that the price of other goods has been increasing, meaning that people are willing to spend more on alpaca overcoats. Additionally, the argument is bolstered by the fact that Sartorian has a new fabric source, which will allow them to produce the alpaca overcoats more efficiently and at a lower cost. This suggests that Sartorian will be able to offer the product at a competitive price, giving them an advantage over other companies.\n\nTo evaluate the strength of this argument, we must consider the counterarguments. One counterargument is that the demand for alpaca overcoats may not be as high as Sartorian suggests. While it is true that the price of other goods has been increasing, it is not necessarily true that people are looking for alpaca overcoats in particular. Additionally, the new fabric source may not be as reliable as Sartorian claims, and the cost savings may not be as great as they suggest.\n\nOverall, the argument that Sartorian is making is plausible and supported by evidence. While there are counterarguments that could be made, the evidence presented by Sartorian suggests that their alpaca overcoat will be a hit.", "esl_essay": "The argument presented in the memo is that there is a strong case for resuming production of the alpaca overcoat due to the new reliable fabric supplier and the lack of competition in the market.

First, it assumes that the mining of copper on the 10,000 square miles of land in West Fredonia will inevitably lead to pollution and environmental disaster. This is a strong statement, as there are many factors that could affect the outcome of mining operations, such as the type of mining methods used, the location of the mine, the regulations in place, and the environmental impact assessments conducted prior to mining. Without more information, it is difficult to determine whether or not mining will lead to pollution and disaster.\n\nSecond, the argument assumes that the only way to prevent this from happening is for consumers to refuse to purchase products made with CCC's copper. This ignores the possibility that other methods of prevention, such as regulation, could be employed. Furthermore, it assumes that the refusal of consumers to purchase products made with CCC's copper is feasible and that the company will not be able to find other buyers for their copper.\n\nFinally, the argument assumes that the endangered animal species in West Fredonia are not able to relocate or adapt to the changing environment. This is a dangerous assumption, as it implies that the species are unable to survive if their current habitat is damaged.", "aae_essay": "The argument presented by the person writing to the editor is that Crust Copper Company (CCC) should stop mining copper in West Fredonia because it will cause an environmental disaster. The writer claims that CCC has already copped over 10,000 square miles of land in West Fredonia and that the mining will damage the area due to the presence of rare species. The writer goes on to suggest that if people refuse to buy products made with CCC copper, the company will be forced to stop mining.\n\nThe argument presented is based on several assumptions. First, it is assumed that CCC has already acquired 10,000 square miles of land in West Fredonia, which has not been confirmed. Second, it is assumed that the mining will damage the area due to the presence of rare species, which has not been proven. Finally, it is assumed that if people refuse to buy products made with CCC copper, the company will be forced to stop mining, which is a long shot.\n\nThe argument presented is weakened by the lack of evidence to back up the assumptions. Furthermore, the argument does not take into account the potential economic benefits of CCC's mining operations. It is also important to consider the potential economic and environmental benefits of the mining, such as the potential for new jobs and the potential for the company to use environmentally friendly practices.\n\nIn conclusion, the argument presented is weakened by the lack of evidence to back up the assumptions and the potential economic and environmental benefits of the mining operations should be taken into consideration.", "esl_essay": "The argument presented in the letter to the editor assumes that the only way to prevent the destruction of the environment in West Fredonia is for consumers to boycott products made with copper from the Crust Copper Company (CCC). This argument depends on the assumption that CCC's mining operations will inevitably lead to pollution and environmental disaster, and that this destruction can be prevented only by consumer action. The implications of this assumption are that CCC's mining operations are likely to cause irreparable damage to the environment, and that consumer action is the only way to prevent this destruction. If the assumption proves unwarranted, then the argument presented in the letter to the editor is weakened."}

Furthermore, the letter does not take into account the potential benefits that organized sports can provide, such as teaching children the importance of teamwork and sportsmanship.\n\nOverall, the letter to the editor of the Parkville Daily newspaper presents an argument that organized sports for children under the age of nine should be discouraged due to the potential risks of injury, the amount of time spent on the activities, and the potential for coaches to put undue pressure on the children to win. However, this argument is based on several assumptions that must be examined in order to fully understand the argument.", "esl_essay": "The argument presented in the letter to the editor assumes that organized athletic competition for children under the age of nine is detrimental to their physical and psychological wellbeing. The argument depends on the assumption that the number of injuries, psychological pressures, and time taken away from academic activities are all greater for youth-league sports than the benefits that come from them. If any of these assumptions are proven false, then the argument loses its strength. \n\nThe implications of this argument are that youth-league sports should be discontinued for children under the age of nine. This would mean that children in this age group would not have access to the physical and psychological benefits that come from organized athletic activities. It could also mean that children in this age group would not have the opportunity to learn important skills such as teamwork, discipline, and sportsmanship."}

While the introduction of trout may have had an effect on the amphibians, it is likely that other factors are also at play. \n\nOne potential factor is habitat destruction.

Additionally, climate change could be playing a role, as warmer temperatures may be negatively impacting the survival of amphibians. \n\nAnother factor to consider is the introduction of invasive species. Non-native species can out-compete native species, and it is possible that an invasive species could be responsible for the decrease in amphibian populations. \n\nFinally, pollution could be a factor. Heavy metals and other toxins from industrial and agricultural sources could be contaminating the water and land, making it difficult for amphibians to survive. \n\nGiven the complexity of the issue, it is clear that more research and investigation is needed to understand why the amphibian population in Xanadu National Park is decreasing.

To back this up, it claims that eight years ago when XYZ was using Walsh, only half their laid-off people found jobs in a year, while those who used Delany found jobs in six months. This is a valid point, but it does not necessarily mean that Delany is better than Walsh. We need to look at the specifics of how many people used each firm, how long each firm has been in business, and the location of the job searches. If Delany has more staff and more locations, that could explain why their clients were able to find jobs faster. Additionally, we need to look at the qualifications of the clients using each firm. Were the clients of Delany more qualified than the clients of Walsh? Were the job searches in the same location or were they spread out? Without this information, it is difficult to make a definitive conclusion.", "esl_essay": "The argument presented in the memo is that XYZ should continue to use Delany Personnel Firm to assist laid-off employees in finding new jobs, rather than switching to the less expensive Walsh Personnel Firm. The argument is based on the premise that Delany is superior to Walsh because it has a larger staff and more branch offices, and that this superiority is evidenced by the fact that its clients took an average of six months to find jobs last year, whereas Walsh's clients took nine months.\n\nTo evaluate this argument, evidence is needed to determine how many clients Delany and Walsh each had last year, how many of Delany's clients found jobs within six months, and how many of Walsh's clients found jobs within nine months.

Additionally, the East Palean Wildlife Preserve also has more open areas, which would make it easier for predators to move around and hunt. \n\nTo further strengthen the argument, one could look at the number of western gazelles that have been sighted in the East Palean Wildlife Preserve over the years.

This evidence could come in the form of data on the number of predator-gazelle encounters in each preserve, or interviews with wildlife experts about the differences in the habitat and the predator populations between the two preserves. \n\nIf the evidence presented shows that the number of predators in the eastern preserve is indeed higher than in the western preserve, and that the western gazelles were more vulnerable to predation in the eastern preserve than in the western preserve, then the argument would be strengthened. This evidence would suggest that the higher number of predators in the eastern preserve was the cause of the virtual elimination of the western gazelles."}

Additionally, the slower pace of life in Leeville may make it easier for people to take time off work to care for themselves or a family member without fear of financial hardship. This could explain why workers in Leeville take fewer sick days than workers in Masonton, even when population size is taken into account.", "aae_essay": "One possible explanation for the lower rates of stress-related sickness in Leeville compared to Masonton is the lower population density in Leeville.

First, we need to look at the demographics of the area and see if there is a large enough population of older listeners to make the switch worthwhile. We also need to consider the current state of the music shops in the area and the sales of rock-and-roll music. Finally, we need to look at the 24/7 news joints in the neighboring towns and assess how they are doing compared to KNOW. \n\nIf the population of older listeners is indeed large enough, and the music shops are selling less rock-and-roll music, then it is likely that the switch to news will be beneficial for KNOW. Additionally, if the 24/7 news joints in the neighboring towns are doing well, then it is likely that there is a market for news and that KNOW can capitalize on it. \n\nOverall, the guess that KNOW should flip to an all-news station is not without its risks, but the potential rewards could be great if the demographics and market conditions are right.", "esl_essay": "In order to evaluate the prediction that switching KNOW radio from rock-and-roll music to 24-hour news will allow the station to attract older listeners and make KNOW radio more profitable than ever, several questions need to be answered.

Additionally, the fact that Fly-Away was handling multiple locations could have caused them to be overwhelmed and unable to dedicate the necessary resources to the Palm City location. On the other hand, Wintervale may have had a more dedicated team that was able to quickly identify and address any pest problems.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the environment at each location. Palm City may have had a more humid climate that was conducive to pest growth, while Wintervale's location may have been more arid and less hospitable to pests. Additionally, the type of food stored at each location could have made a difference in the amount of damage caused by pests. For example, if Palm City was storing food that was more attractive to pests, such as sweets or fruits, then Fly-Away may have been unable to prevent the amount of damage seen.\n\nFinally, the amount of time that each pest control company had been working at each location could have made a difference. If Fly-Away had been working at Palm City for a longer period of time, they may have become more familiar with the pest problem and better equipped to handle it. On the other hand, Wintervale may have been able to quickly identify and address any pest problems due to their longer tenure at the location.", "esl_essay": "One possible explanation for the difference in pest damage between the two warehouses is that the Fly-Away Pest Control Company may not have been providing the same level of service as Buzzoff Pest Control Company. It is possible that the higher level of service provided by Buzzoff Pest Control Company is the reason why less food was damaged in their warehouse. Additionally, the location of the warehouses could be a factor; the warehouse in Palm City may have been more prone to pest infestations due to its location or the climate in that area. Finally, the amount of food stored in each warehouse could be a factor; the warehouse in Palm City may have had more food stored, which would be more attractive to pests."}

While this may be true in some cases, it is not the only factor that should be taken into account. The second assumption is that the effectiveness of the pest control is not as important as the cost. This is a dangerous assumption to make, as it could lead to more damage to the food supplies if the pests are not properly controlled. \n\nThe VP is also implying that the cost of pest control is the same across all locations, which is not necessarily true.

This puts the onus on those who would be tempted to cheat to think twice before doing so, as they know they will be held accountable if they are caught. Additionally, the honor code encourages a culture of honesty and respect among the students, as they are all held to the same standards and must police one another. This creates a sense of community and mutual respect that may be lacking in a system where students fear being caught by their teachers. \n\nFurthermore, the honor code may have also helped to reduce the pressure on teachers to police their students. With the code in place, teachers can focus more of their energy on teaching and less on policing their students. This can lead to better-prepared students and a better learning environment overall. \n\nFinally, the honor code may have simply been more effective than the old system of policing. Teachers may have been able to catch fewer students cheating, but they may have also been missing more cases due to a lack of trust from the students. With the honor code in place, students are more likely to report any wrongdoing, knowing that they will be taken seriously. \n\nOverall, the honor code seems to have been effective in reducing cheating at Groveton College, and these three possible explanations provide a plausible explanation for why this is the case.", "esl_essay": "One possible explanation for the success of the honor code is that it has created a sense of accountability among students.

This sense of pride and accountability may be enough to deter students from cheating. \n\nAnother possible explanation is that the honor code has made it easier for students to report incidents of cheating. Before the code was implemented, students may have been reluctant to report cheating for fear of being seen as a tattle-tale. With the honor code in place, students now feel more comfortable coming forward when they suspect cheating, knowing that their peers will be held accountable. \n\nFinally, the honor code may have simply been effective in reducing cheating because it is a more effective method of enforcement than the old system of teacher monitoring.

The second assumption is that no problems with showers have been reported since the adjustment.

The management claims that this will not cause any issues with water pressure and that there have been no complaints from tenants. However, this plan is based on a number of assumptions that need to be examined. \n\nFirst, the management assumes that the showerheads in the other nine buildings will not need to be adjusted, even though the water flow in those showerheads may be higher than the newly adjusted ones. This assumption is based on the idea that the other buildings have showerheads of the same type and age as the ones in the first three buildings, which is not necessarily true. Additionally, the management does not take into account any potential changes in water pressure throughout the buildings due to the adjustments made in the first three buildings. \n\nSecond, the management assumes that the tenants of Sunnyside Towers will not be aware of the changes made to the showerheads and will not notice any difference in water pressure. This is a risky assumption, as tenants may be more aware of changes to their living environment than the management expects. Furthermore, tenants may be more likely to notice changes in water pressure if the adjustments are made in the first three buildings, since they are more likely to use those showers more frequently. \n\nFinally, the management assumes that the adjustments to the showerheads will not cause any health or safety issues. This is a major assumption, as the water flow from the showerheads may be too low to properly clean tenants or cause them to slip and fall. Additionally, the management does not consider the possibility that the adjustments could cause an increase in water waste, which could lead to higher water bills for the tenants. \n\nOverall, the Sunnyside Towers management has proposed an interesting plan to save money on water costs, but it is based on a number of assumptions that need to be examined. It is important to consider the potential impacts of the adjustments to the showerheads in the first three buildings, as well as the potential changes in water pressure throughout the entire complex. Additionally, the health and safety of the tenants should be taken into account, as well as the potential for increased water waste. Until these assumptions are examined and addressed, the management should not move forward with this plan.", "esl_essay": "The argument presented in the letter from the owner of the Sunnyside Towers apartment complex to its manager depends on several assumptions.

This assumes that the same savings will be seen in the other buildings as was seen in the first three buildings. \n\nIf any of these assumptions prove unwarranted, then the argument presented in the letter is weakened. For example, if the water usage before and after the modification is not available, then it is not possible to know if the modification will result in a considerable saving for the corporation. Additionally, if there are complaints about low water pressure or other issues with the showers, then this could weaken the argument that the modification will not cause any problems.

On the other hand, it is also possible that the students in Marlee are simply able to dedicate more time and focus to their assignments, allowing them to complete them more quickly and efficiently.\n\nTo better understand the impact of homework, we can look at the research on the subject.

Second, it assumes that the increase in private contributions and attendance at the symphony's outdoor summer concert series is solely due to the internationally known conductor and the attractive guest musicians he has been able to bring in. Finally, it assumes that the city's funding of the symphony is no longer necessary.\n\nThe first assumption is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that the symphony has become self-sustaining due to the increased private contributions and attendance.

Furthermore, the city is not taking into account the potential long-term effects of cutting off the orchestra's funding, such as a decrease in attendance and a decrease in the quality of performances.

In recent years, the school has been considering the possibility of admitting men into their programs. The president and the governing committee have stated that coeducation would bring more students to the school and increase alumnae engagement. However, when the student government and alumnae were surveyed, 80% of them were in favor of keeping the school all-female and more than half of the alumnae expressed opposition to coeducation. \n\nThe argument presented by the president and the governing committee is based on the assumption that coeducation will bring more students and alumnae engagement. However, this assumption is not necessarily true. It is possible that the school's long-standing tradition of educating women is part of what has made it successful and that coeducation could actually have the opposite effect. Additionally, the student and alumnae surveys do not necessarily reflect the true opinion of the entire student body or alumnae. It is possible that the surveys were not fully representative of the opinions of the entire student body or alumnae, or that the surveys were not taken seriously. \n\nIn conclusion, the argument presented by the president and the governing committee is based on a potentially false assumption and does not take into account the potential backlash that coeducation could cause. It is possible that the school would actually be better off staying with its current tradition of educating women.", "esl_essay": "The recommendation made by the president and administrative staff of Grove College to the college's governing committee is based on several assumptions. The first assumption is that admitting men will increase the number of applicants to the college. This is based on the idea that men will be attracted to the college if it becomes coeducational. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this is the case. The second assumption is that the majority of students and alumnae want the college to remain all-female. This is based on the results of a survey conducted by the student government and alumnae. However, it is not clear how representative the sample size of the survey is, or if the opinions of the majority truly reflect the views of the entire student body and alumnae. The third assumption is that preserving the all-female environment of the college will improve morale and financial support. This is based on the idea that an all-female environment will create a sense of community and camaraderie among the students and alumnae. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this is the case. \n\nIf any of these assumptions prove to be false, then the argument that the college should remain all-female is weakened.

However, the poll also suggests that educational institutions are not as popular of a cause as other organizations, suggesting that people may prioritize other causes over education.", "aae_essay": "There are several reasons why schools may not be receiving as much donation money as other charities despite the fact that people have more money to spend this year. One reason is that people may be prioritizing other causes, such as helping those in need overseas or protecting the environment, over helping schools. Additionally, people may be more focused on helping their local communities, which could mean that schools are not getting the attention they need. Furthermore, people may be donating to larger, more established charities that have more recognition and a larger presence than schools. Finally, people may be more hesitant to donate to organizations that they don't feel are making the most of their money, which could be the case with some schools.", "esl_essay": "An alternative explanation for the decline in donations to educational institutions could be that people are instead donating to other causes that are more closely aligned with their personal values. For example, some people may prioritize environmental causes over educational ones, or may be more interested in helping those in need abroad rather than in their own communities. Additionally, the rise of online education and the increasing cost of college tuition may be making people less willing to donate to educational institutions."}

This shift has allowed for economies of scale, meaning that the same amount of milk can be produced with fewer resources. Additionally, advances in technology have allowed for automation of the milking process, further reducing the need for human labor. These factors have likely contributed to the increase in milk production and efficiency, which could explain the decrease in labor costs.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that the price of milk and cream has been driven up by market forces. Demand for milk and cream has increased, while the supply has remained relatively constant. This has caused prices to rise in order to balance the market. Additionally, the cost of production for dairy farmers may have increased, resulting in higher prices for the consumer.\n\nFinally, it is possible that dairy farmers are simply taking advantage of the current market conditions to increase their profits.

This could be due to a variety of factors, such as an increase in demand for dairy products, a decrease in the supply of milk, or a shift in the type of milk being produced. \n\nDemand for dairy products could be driving up the price of cream. Relanna is a growing city, and with more people comes more demand for dairy products. This could be causing farmers to increase the price of cream to compensate for the increased demand and keep their profits up. Additionally, if the type of milk being produced is shifting away from skim milk and more towards whole milk, this could be driving up the price of cream as well. Whole milk takes more resources to produce and is more profitable for farmers, so they may be incentivized to switch to producing it. \n\nIn conclusion, the argument presented suggests that the price of cream has doubled in the last two years, and there are several potential reasons for this. An increase in demand for dairy products and a shift in the type of milk being produced could be driving up the price.", "esl_essay": "One possible explanation for the dramatic increase in the price of cream is that the cost of production has risen. It is possible that the cost of milk and other dairy products has increased significantly, leading to higher prices for cream.

This could be due to changing tastes or an increase in the popularity of cream-based products. If the demand for cream is greater than the supply, then the price will rise in order to balance the market. \n\nFinally, it is possible that the price of cream is being artificially inflated by the farmers in order to increase their profits.

First, we need to look at the current moped rental situation on the island and assess how the cap would affect it. We should also consider the potential impact of the cap on the number of moped-related accidents, as well as the economic implications of the cap. Finally, we should consider the potential unintended consequences of the cap, such as an increase in the number of people driving their own mopeds or an increase in the number of people using other forms of transportation. \n\nTo begin, the current moped rental situation on Balmer Island is quite high. With over 50 rental spots currently available, there is a high demand for mopeds. This has led to a number of moped-related accidents, as well as complaints from local businesses about the number of mopeds on the road. The cap would likely reduce the number of mopeds on the road, as rental spots would be limited to 25 per day. This could lead to a decrease in the number of accidents, as there would be fewer mopeds on the road. \n\nThe cap could also have an economic impact. With fewer mopeds available for rent, rental companies may be forced to raise their prices, which could lead to an increase in the cost of mopeds for tourists. This could lead to a decrease in tourism on the island, as people may be unable to afford to rent a moped. On the other hand, the cap could also lead to an increase in the number of people driving their own mopeds, which could lead to a decrease in the cost of mopeds for locals. \n\nFinally, we should consider the potential unintended consequences of the cap. If the cap is too low, it may lead to an increase in the number of people driving their own mopeds, which could lead to more pollution and a decrease in safety. Additionally, if the cap is too high, it may lead to an increase in the number of people using other forms of transportation, such as cars, which could lead to more traffic and a decrease in the number of pedestrians on the island. \n\nOverall, the cap on moped rentals on Balmer Island is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of a number of factors. We need to look at the current moped rental situation, the potential impact on moped-related accidents, the economic implications, and the potential unintended consequences.

This evidence is further supported by reports that the deer are now having to venture further and further south in order to find suitable food sources, which is not a behavior they have had to do in the past. \n\nHowever, this argument could be weakened if reports from local hunters were to contradict each other, or if reports from scientists showed that the sea ice is not in fact melting, or if reports from other sources showed that the deer are in fact thriving.", "aae_essay": "In order to evaluate the argument that Arctic deer populations are decreasing due to the melting of sea ice, we need to look at both the evidence presented and the potential implications of the melting sea ice. First, we need to consider the evidence presented by local hunters that deer numbers are indeed decreasing. This evidence is anecdotal, but it is still important to consider as it suggests that something is causing a decrease in deer populations. We can then look at scientific data to determine if there has been a decrease in sea ice in the Arctic regions, which could be causing the deer to be unable to migrate and therefore leading to a decrease in their population. \n\nIf we look at satellite data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, we can see that the amount of sea ice in the Arctic has been steadily decreasing over the past few decades. This data shows that the amount of sea ice in the Arctic has decreased by 12.7% per decade since 1980. This decrease in sea ice could be the cause of the decrease in deer populations, as the deer are unable to migrate across the sea ice to reach food sources on other islands. \n\nThe decrease in sea ice also has implications for the environment and ecosystems in the Arctic. As the sea ice melts, it exposes more of the ocean to the sun\u2019s heat, which can cause further warming of the Arctic region and lead to further decreases in sea ice. This can cause a positive feedback loop, leading to further decreases in sea ice and further disruption of the Arctic ecosystem. \n\nOverall, the evidence presented suggests that the decrease in sea ice in the Arctic is likely causing a decrease in Arctic deer populations. This decrease in deer populations could have implications for the environment and ecosystems in the Arctic, as the deer are a key part of the food chain. To fully understand the implications of this decrease in deer populations, we need to look at the larger picture and consider the effects of the decrease in sea ice on the Arctic environment.", "esl_essay": "The argument that Arctic deer populations are declining due to global warming is supported by reports from local hunters that the deer populations are indeed declining.

It is possible that the college is overestimating the number of students and the rate of growth, or that the cost of living off-campus may not continue to increase. Additionally, the college may be able to find alternative solutions to the housing problem, such as increasing the number of existing dorms or building smaller, more affordable dorms. \n\nOverall, the argument that Buckingham needs to build more dorms in order to accommodate the increasing number of students is not entirely convincing. Further research and evidence is needed to determine the exact needs of the student body and the potential costs of building new dorms.", "esl_essay": "The argument presented in the memo is that Buckingham College should build new dormitories in order to meet the growing housing needs of its students and to make it easier for students to afford housing. The evidence presented is that enrollment is projected to double in the next 50 years and that rental prices have increased in the town. This would make existing dormitory space insufficient and make off-campus housing more difficult to afford. Finally, attractive new dormitories would make prospective students more likely to enroll at Buckingham.\n\nIn order to evaluate this argument, evidence should be presented that shows the actual growth of enrollment and rental prices over the next 50 years. This would provide a more accurate prediction of the need for new dormitories and the affordability of off-campus housing. Additionally, evidence should be presented that shows the impact of attractive new dormitories on student enrollment."}

So, the word is all colleges and universities oughta get on board with honor codes like Groveton's to cut down on cheatin'.\n\nNow, write up somethin' talkin' 'bout what kinda questions we gotta answer to figure if this suggestion and the thinkin' behind it make sense. Make sure you break down how the answers to these questions gon' help check if the recommendation is solid.", "esl_prompt": "According to recent report, cheating among college and university students is on the rise. However, Groveton College has successful reduced student cheating by adopting an honor code, which calls for students to agree not cheat in their academic endeavors and to notify a faculty member if they suspect that others have cheated. Groveton's honor code replaced a system where teachers closely monitored students; under that system, teachers reported an average of thirty cases of cheating per year. In the first year the honor code was in place, students reported twenty-one cases of cheating; five years later, this number had dropped to fourteen. Moreover, in a recent survey, a majority of Groveton students said that they would be less likely to cheat with an honor code in place than without. Thus, all colleges and universities should adopt honor codes similar to Groveton's in order to decrease cheating among students.\nWrite a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answer in order to decide whether the recommendation and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these question would help to evaluate the recommendation.", "sae_essay": "In order to decide whether the recommendation and the argument on which it is based are reasonable, we must answer several questions. First, what is the definition of cheating? Second, what are the potential consequences of cheating? Third, how effective is an honor code in preventing cheating? Fourth, how likely are students to report cheating under an honor code system? Finally, how do students feel about an honor code system? \n\nAnswering these questions will help to evaluate the recommendation. If we know that cheating is defined as using unauthorized materials or receiving help from another person during an exam, then we can determine whether the honor code is effective in preventing cheating. If we know the potential consequences of cheating, such as suspension or expulsion from school, then we can understand the seriousness of the issue. If we know how likely students are to report cheating, then we can understand the effectiveness of the honor code. Finally, if we know how students feel about the honor code, then we can understand their level of compliance. \n\nOverall, the recommendation and argument are reasonable and can be evaluated by answering the questions posed.", "aae_essay": "To answer the question of whether or not honor codes are effective in reducing cheating, we must first consider the definition of cheating. Cheating is defined as the use of unauthorized assistance or information to gain an advantage on an assignment or test. An honor code is a set of guidelines that outlines expected academic standards and behavior. It is important to consider how honor codes define cheating and how they define acceptable behavior. For example, if honor codes do not explicitly forbid the use of unauthorized assistance, then it is difficult to determine whether a student is cheating or not.\n\nWe must also consider the effectiveness of honor codes in terms of student compliance. Does the honor code have enough teeth to ensure that students will comply with its standards? Does the code provide enough guidance and clarity to ensure that students understand what is and is not allowed? Does the code provide enough consequences for students who do not comply?\n\nFinally, we must consider the effectiveness of honor codes in terms of their impact on cheating behavior. Does the code have a significant impact on reducing cheating? Does the code have any effect on the overall academic culture of the school? Does the code create an atmosphere of trust and respect between students and faculty? Does the code provide any additional resources to help students understand the importance of academic integrity?\n\nAnswering these questions will help to determine whether or not honor codes are effective in reducing cheating.", "esl_essay": "In order to decide whether the recommendation and the argument based on it are reasonable, we need to answer several questions. First, what is the definition of cheating? Is it defined by the honor code or by some other standard? Second, how does the honor code define plagiarism? Does it include any other forms of cheating, such as collusion or fabrication of data? Third, how does the honor code define academic integrity? Does it include any other forms of academic dishonesty, such as taking an exam for another student? Fourth, how does the honor code define a faculty member? Does it specify who is considered a faculty member, such as teaching assistants or guest lecturers? Finally, how does the honor code define a student? Does it specify any particular student status, such as undergraduate or graduate? Answering these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation and the argument based on it."}
